    "content": "Releases\nPARIS, June 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin, Korea Aerospace Industries and Red 6 today announced they have begun developing engineering solutions and a technology roadmap to establish an implementation path for Red 6's Advanced Tactical Augmented Reality System (ATARS), into the T-50 platform and associated ground-based training systems.\nInitial technology integration includes a T-50 demonstrator and the Red 6 ATARS technology that is electronically networked with the Lockheed Martin Prepar3D software simulation suite. This early engineering solution provides Lockheed Martin and Red 6 additional experience in integrating simulations which could eventually comprise embedded training for the T-50 program and ground-based training systems.\n\"ATARS addresses the critical training inefficiencies in today's training platforms. There has never been a training environment in which you can combine virtual assets being visually represented in the real outdoor world, and the opportunity to overlay this training into ground-based training, until now,\" says Daniel Robinson, founder and CEO at Red 6.\nATARS is a multi-node, all-domain augmented reality (AR) system that delivers a complete outdoor synthetic training environment for multiple users. Red 6 technology allows pilots to experience the cognitive loads of physically flying airplanes while capturing the value of synthetics by enabling them to enter realistic, scalable in range and ratio, secure, simulated training environments while airborne in the most dynamic of outdoor environments.\n\"Our vision is to help our customers leverage emerging technologies to seamlessly and securely connect all assets for joint missions, and enable fast and decisive action,\" said Aimee Burnett, vice president, Business Development for the Integrated Fighter Group at Lockheed Martin. \"Lockheed Martin has made significant advances in digital engineering and built strategic partnerships that are enabling us to accelerate development across our platforms.\n\"One such example is continued integration with Red 6 as we look to build advanced 21st Century Security capabilities that support our customers' needs,\" Burnett continued.\nBurnett added the T-50 program remains in demand around the world. Lockheed Martin recently submitted the TF-50A variant for the U.S. Air Force's trainer program to serve three near-term missions including tactical training, adversary air support and tactical fighter surrogate. The TF-50A is configured as a light attack fighter/trainer with additional enhancements to include radar, electronic warfare system, tactical data link and other capabilities to meet Air Combat Command requirements.\nLockheed Martin also submitted the TF-50N variant for the U.S. Navy's trainer program. The TF-50N is uniquely configured to meet multiple U.S. Navy missions including pilot landing qualification, adversary air, training/chase and tactical surrogate.\nWhile the ATARS system is initially targeted for the T-50 program, it could eventually be applied to operational Lockheed Martin platforms such as the F-16, F-22 and F-35.\nRed 6 is a Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio company.\nAbout Lockheed Martin\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 116,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\nPlease follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation.\nAbout Red 6\nRed 6, founded in 2018, is the creator of Advanced Tactical Augmented Reality System (ATARS), and Augmented Reality Command and Analytic Data Environment (ARCADE).

    "content": "USAF welcomes delivery of first operational T-7A Red Hawk\nJanuary 13, 2026\nThe US Air Force (USAF) ushered its first new-generation T-7A Red Hawk advanced jet trainer into operational service on 7 January, when a formal arrival ceremony for the type was held at Air Education and Training Command\u2019s (AETC\u2019s) headquarters at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph (JBSA-R) in Texas.\nThis recent ceremony comes after the USAF\u2019s first operational T-7A (serial 21-7005) was delivered to the Texas base from Boeing\u2019s fighter production plant in St Louis, Missouri, on 5 December. Having now arrived at JBSA-R, the new aircraft has formally joined the 12th Flying Training Wing\u2019s (FTW\u2019s) 99th Flying Training Squadron (FTS).\nA previous operator of the T-1 Jayhawk multi-engine jet trainer, the 99th FTS \u2013 whose lineage goes back to the Tuskegee Airmen \u2013 has become the first USAF squadron to begin its transition to the Red Hawk. As a result, the unit will lead early operational efforts to help refine training concepts and establish the conditions for the USAF\u2019s future T-7A squadrons.\nLt Col Michael Trott, the officer commanding the 99th FTS, described the importance of his unit\u2019s new mission: \u201cThe 99th will re-write what pilot production looks like and shape the future of pilot training for the next generation of warfighters for America.\u201d\nSo far, Boeing has delivered five production-representative Red Hawks to the USAF. Of these initial Red Hawks, four are currently assigned to the 416th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS), which is leading the test and evaluation campaign for the new advanced trainer at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) in California. The fifth of these jets (21-7005) has now been delivered to the 99th FTS, which is set to field an initial force of 14 jets by 2027.\nIn total, the USAF plans to field a 351-strong fleet of T-7As. The platform is expected to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2027. A firm production decision on the T-7A was initially expected to be made in 2025, but the USAF delayed this until 2026 and instead opted to acquire four more production-representative test airframes from Boeing.\nThe USAF plans to purchase 14 production-standard T-7As in FY2026, with the goal of increasing its annual purchase to between 40-60 aircraft by 2033.\nT-38C: Beginning of the End\nThis recent delivery marks the beginning of a new era in the training of future USAF fighter pilots as the service presses on with its quest to modernise its primary jet trainer fleet. For more than six decades, the service\u2019s now-veteran T-38C Talon fleet has formed the backbone of its fast-jet training syllabus.\nHowever, due to its advanced age and circa-1960s design, the Talon fleet is now struggling with maintenance issues and unavoidable obsolescence, becoming more expensive to maintain and no longer being representative of the technologies and capabilities offered by modern combat jets, such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II.\nIt lacks the modern digital systems and avionics required to prepare new-generation pilots for complex, multi-domain warfighting in fifth- and future sixth-generation fighters, like Boeing\u2019s F-47.\nWhile the USAF will eventually replace its ageing T-38Cs with the T-7A, but this process won\u2019t start until enough Red Hawks have been handed over to the service. According to Cirium, the USAF still maintains a fleet of more than 480 T-38s. Despite this, USAF officials have cited availability issues with the platform as contributing to ongoing delays in the fast-jet pilot training pipeline.\nT-7A Red Hawk: A Modern Jet Training Solution\nThe new T-7A represents a major step-change in the USAF\u2019s ability to train its new-generation fighter pilots.\nCommenting on this, Lt Gen Clark J Quinn \u2013 the officer commanding AETC \u2013 said: \u201cThe T-7 isn\u2019t simply a modern upgrade. It\u2019s a generational leap that will be an important part of AETC for decades to come\u2026 The arrival of the T-7A is not the finish line. It marks the beginning of the work ahead to deliver training that produces ready, capable pilots for the future of the Air Force.\u201d\nUnlike the T-38, the Red Hawk has been built with advanced digital engineering and modern fly-by-wire avionics, complete with an all-glass digital cockpit and an open-systems architecture that allows the type to evolve alongside future training requirements and emerging technologies through hardware/software updates.\nThe T-7A also forms part of an integrated holistic system of advanced simulators \u2013 namely via the inclusion of a Ground-Based Training System (GBTS) and Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) environments \u2013 to reduce costs while addressing more complex flight training scenarios on the ground.\nJointly developed by Boeing and Saab, the first Red Hawk prototype for the USAF\u2019s competitive T-X programme was unveiled on 13 September 2016.\nPowered by a single GE Aerospace F404 afterburning turbofan engine \u2013 producing up to 17,200lbf (77kN) of thrust with afterburner \u2013 the design featured two vertical stabilisers with a traditional two-seat tandem cockpit configuration and retractable tricycle landing gear.\nThe Boeing-Saab team\u2019s first T-X prototype took flight on 20 December 2016, before the USAF formally selected the solution as the winner of the T-X programme in September 2018.\nSince its selection by the USAF, the T-7A Red Hawk has become the focus of other air arms that are looking to recapitalise their advanced jet trainer fleets. A navalised version of the Red Hawk is currently in contention for the US Navy\u2019s ongoing Undergraduate Jet Training System programme, which aims to replace the service\u2019s ageing fleet of T-45C Goshawks.\nMeanwhile, BAE Systems has also teamed up with Boeing and Saab to pitch the T-7A as a viable replacement for the Royal Air Force\u2019s (RAF\u2019s) veteran fleet of Hawk T1/T2 jet trainers, which have been plagued by engine-related maintenance issues over recent years. Australia, Brazil, Japan and Serbia have also been linked with a potential Red Hawk purchase.\nFeatured image: USAF/Benjamin Faske"

BAe, in turn, dates to the merger (1977, with two other firms) of British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Hawker Siddeley Aviation, both having been nationalized a year earlier owing to unprofitable financial situations. Through its BAe antecedents, BAE Systems carries the legacy of some 20 British aircraft firms (e.g., Bristol, Avro, Gloster, De Havilland, Supermarine), several dating to the first decades of flight. In the 1960s and early \u201970s, BAC and Hawker Siddeley each produced significant aircraft. BAC built the Vickers-Armstrongs VC10 and BAC One-Eleven jetliners and, in partnership with Aerospatiale of France, the Concorde supersonic transport. Hawker Siddeley developed the HS 121 Trident jetliner, Vulcan bomber, and Harrier vertical/short-takeoff-and-landing (V/STOL) fighter. In 1979 British Aerospace joined the Airbus Industrie jetliner-manufacturing consortium, and during the early 1980s it became privatized. In the 1990s it became a partner with firms in Germany, Italy, and Spain in the Eurofighter Typhoon program.

Wars with a peer rival will be in highly contested battle spaces, requiring aerial platforms to be more survivable, to jam, prevent jamming and undertake fires while also defeating incoming enemy missiles.\nIn fact, the latest contract underscores the critical role of attack helicopters in the European theater and the significance of electronic warfare (EW). The U.S. is shifting focus back to the helicopter\u2019s Cold Wars-era role for the massive land war that might potentially emerge with Russia.\nMoscow leads both in diversity and sophistication of both its EW systems and its attack helicopter fleet (Ka-52, Mi-28 and Mi-35). Moreover, it uses dedicated EW helicopters like the Mi-8 MTPR-1 to accompany its strike helicopters, unburdening a lot of the load on the attack helicopters.\nThe war in Ukraine has also seen both NATO and Russia learning the limitations of their AD (Air Defense) systems, with Russia particularly possibly looking to enhance the seekers and guidance systems of its Tor and Pantsir medium and short-range point defense systems. Given the scenarios U.S. Army Apaches are practicing in Europe, they would have to contend with a lot of Russian aerial and ground radar reconnaissance and AD.\nTo face these threats, the Apache would need to endure heavier computational power while scanning radio frequencies, analyzing pulse widths, pulse durations of both ground radar and missiles\u2019 radar seekers and rapidly classifying and alerting on threats. These, in turn, need modern computers and other electronic hardware for processing such high volumes of data, something where Russia has historically lagged, as The Aviationist had discussed in a previous article regarding its AEW&C aircraft.\nAdvanced EW through advanced chips\nThrough the SHIP project, Intel\u2019s Altera developed the MCP-2 that can be customized to different functions. With STAMP, meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and Altera \u201coptimized architectures that leveraged the MCP-2 microchip for electronic warfare applications.\u201d\nThe Gen 3 RFI systems will be powered by \u201cstate-of-the-art microelectronics and modern software capabilities,\u201d resulting in \u201cimproved sensor performance in a smaller, lighter package\u201d for the Apache.\u201d The company further added that, \u201cthrough this upgrade, Lockheed Martin will complete the development, build, and qualification of the Gen 3 RFI system, with the long-term plan to replace all currently fielded Gen 2 systems and integrate the Gen 3 system on all Apache aircraft.\u201d\nDwa zestrzelone dzi\u015b \u015bmig\u0142owce Mi-8 to prawdopodobnie zmodyfikowane do wersji MTPR.\nModyfikacje polegaj\u0105 na zamontowaniu na pok\u0142adzie systemu zak\u0142\u00f3cania \u201eRyczag-AW\u201d.

Among other benefits, the service hopes this will lead to the sorts of rapid, over-the-air software updates for its warships similar to those routinely done by America\u2019s technology behemoths.\nOperating a key piece of software for aircraft carriers and amphibs, the SSDS, on the latest developmental hardware being designed for ICS is another major step towards that goal of software and hardware independence.\n\u201cThe team was able to do that successfully and virtualize a recent software build of SSDS, and then have it run on the new hardware that\u2019s been selected for the ICS,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep adding to these demonstrations that we\u2019re doing \u2026 as we continue to develop the ICS and as we move along and showing the progression of it.\u201d\nGiven the sprawling nature of the ICS\u2019s mission, the Navy is working with numerous companies to bring all the necessary technologies together. In October 2023, the service awarded Lockheed Martin a $1 billion contract for the systems engineering and software integration of ICS \u2014 in other words, to take point on the engineering lift required to bring it to fruition.\nBreaking Defense exclusively reported this February an in-depth view of the other key Navy facility developing the ICS, which the service has dubbed \u201cThe Foundry.\u201d Whereas \u201cThe Forge\u201d is focused specifically on software development, the otherwise incognito Navy building in Dahlgren, Va., has been tasked with producing the hardware destined for the ICS.

    "content": "There was a time when optical sights were seen as something of a \u2018luxury\u2019 item and when night sights were prohibitively expensive and often offered compromised performance. Now for most modern militaries, the idea of not having their assault rifles equipped with an optic as a minimum would be unthinkable. The objective of this article is to a look at some of the recent developments in small arms sights.\nBackground\nTechnology has, and continues to advance, offering higher levels of accuracy in both day and night conditions for sights. Higher accuracy equals higher lethality with fewer rounds expended and this is the crux of the matter.\nMore challenging requirements and the advances in technology that will make those requirements a reality are continuing to drive developments in sights. One area where improvements could be made for night/thermal sights is the provision of batteries offering more power and a sustained operational capability over longer periods. Bearing in mind the large investment being put into advanced battery systems for a whole host of military applications, it would be fair to assume that advances in battery performance are guaranteed over the next few years.\nAnother critical future development for small arms is already on the horizon. This is the digital fire control system. In essence, this consists of an optic being linked to a fire control computer, with the computer taking into account temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, distance and weapon and ammunition ballistics. This translates into the fire control system providing the optimum engagement parameters, which provides a significant increase in accuracy, higher hit probabilities and therefore higher lethality.\nProgrammes Today and Tomorrow\nArguably the most significant Western small arms programme currently in development is the US Army Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) programme to replace the M4 carbine with the NGSW-Rifle (NGSW-R) and the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) with the NGSW-Automatic Rifle (NGSW-AR). Both of these new weapons will share a fire control system known as the NGSW-FC, in January, via the US Army PEO Soldier PM Soldier Lethality. It was announced that the NGSW-FC had been awarded to Vortex Optics. In a contract that could be worth up to US$2.7Bn, the company could supply up to 250,000 XM157 NGSW-FC systems over the next 10 years.\nOthers are making progress in this new fire control system marketplace. For example, Raytheon ELCAN in Canada have developed the SPECTER Digital Fire Control Sight (DFCS), which has a 1-8x optic linked to a fire control computer. While integrated fire control systems will play a key role in the future, in the present ELCAN can point to significant progress with its optical sighting systems in Europe.\nThe ELCAN SPECTER\nELCAN emerged as a force in the optic marketplace back in the 1980s when the Canadian Forces replaced their C1/C1A1 (license produced FN FAL) 7.62\u00d751 mm battle rifles with the C7 assault rifle and C8 carbine in 5.56\u00d745 mm manufactured by Dimaco (later Colt Canada). The Canadian Forces required a new optic for the rifle, selecting the ELCAN SPECTER OS, a 3.4x optic and giving it the C79 designation. As the C7 and C8 gained international sales, the C79 was the selected optic, being acquired by Denmark and the Netherlands. Other customers outside the C7/C8 envelope selected the optic for different applications. These included the US Army and Britain.\nUS Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) asked ELCAN to develop a new sight in 2005 and this led to dual-role sight combining a CQB red dot sight and a rifle combat optic. The resulting system was known as the SPECTER DR. This sight was adopted by USSOCOM, British and Canadian Special Forces, as well as by Australia, Italy and Norway. The SPECTER DR has been continuously developed and has recently won two significant contracts in Europe, with sight deliveries already commencing. The first of these contracts was with Denmark who ordered the SPECTER DR 1-4x optic for their Gev\u00e6r M/10 (Colt Canada C8 IUR) assault rifles and the M60E6 light machine guns, with the 1.5-6x variant of the SPECTER DR being acquired for the M2HB heavy machine gun.\nIn November 2021, ELCAN announced that working with Leonardo Germany, they had been awarded the German main combat sight (HKV) contract. Leonardo Germany is the prime contractor for the contract, with ELCAN supplying the SPECTER 1-4x optic, with 107,929 optics contracted for and deliveries commenced in the third quarter of 2021.\nElsewhere in Europe, others are also upgrading their optical sight capabilities. Lithuania awarded Meopta of the Czech Republic a contract valued at nearly \u20ac4M covering the supply of four thousand optical sights in March 2021. The first batch of 830 optical sights was received on 24 December 2021, with all sights to be delivered to Lithuania by the end of 2022. The sights will be used with G36 5.56\u00d745 mm rifles of the National Defence Volunteer Force, effectively a territorial defence force.\nMeprolight\nIsrael has a major small arms capability in the shape of Israel Weapon Industries (IWI). It also has a major sight manufacturing capability in the shape of Meprolight. Both companies are part of the SK Group, the largest privately-owned defence company in the country, and the fourth-largest defence company in Israel. As with other Israeli defence companies, Meprolight works closely with Israel Defence Force (IDF), to develop defence technologies and to meet the operational requirements of the IDF with the appropriate systems.\nFor example, the Meprolight M5 electro-optical red dot sight was developed to meet IDF requirements and is now the standard IDF sight in this category. One advantage that it has is that the sight works with GEN II and GEN III NVGs and magnifiers, without decreasing the field of view of the sight.\nA recent development at Meprolight is the TIGON, which they describe as a hybrid thermal and red dot sight. The aim here was to have a cost effective sight that could operate in day and night environments, thereby removing the need to have a separate clip-on thermal sight. If required a magnifier can be fitted behind the sight. Powered by two standard AA batteries, the sight can be powered for thousands of hours in day mode and in the thermal mode there is enough power of five hours of continuous operation. The point of the sight is that it allows increased night combat capabilities across the force at an affordable price. It is understood that the IDF is testing the TIGON and that a number of countries in South America and Europe are interested. Potential users are special forces, regular ground forces and even law enforcement.\nIn the final analysis, there is widespread acceptance that small arms require effective optical sights to meet their full potential. There are no shortage of choices in this sector to meet most conceivable needs. However, it would appear that the future will eventually belong to digital fire control systems, assuming they avoid being too complex, too heavy and too expensive."

Arquimea and Lockheed Martin Skunk Works\u00ae, have successfully completed the development of an enhanced anomaly detection capability for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms such as drones and other systems piloted by artificial intelligence agents, which substantially improves the scanning of mission areas.\nThis innovative technology significantly reduces the number of scans a sensor must perform to identify unusual patterns or deviations from expected behavior in data, systems or processes-specifically in the electro-optical and infrared spectra-dramatically improving the detection of changes in physical characteristics, which simplifies and speeds up decision making in strategic environments.\nThis capability has already been tested on board an unmanned aerial system (UAS) flying over a jungle environment. Thanks to its advanced technology, the system was able to identify changes in the physical characteristics of the terrain from episodic memories trained on neural networks. By comparing these observations with the stored \u2018memories\u2019, the system was able to detect critical irregularities and generate unique views of the environment using machine learning algorithms, allowing the mission to be readapted.\nThis advance has proven its value even for predicting image features that may not be visible from a single viewpoint.

    "content": "PALMDALE, Calif., April 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin Skunk Works\u00ae (NYSE: LMT), the global technology company's advanced aerospace development division, in collaboration with Arquimea demonstrated an anomaly detection capability for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms as they scan a mission area.\nThis cutting-edge capability reduces the number of scans by a sensor to identify unusual patterns or deviations from expected behavior in data, systems, or processes \u2013 specifically in the electro optical and infrared spectra \u2013 and dramatically improves the detection of changes in physical features. These approaches have proven valuable for predicting image characteristics that may not be visible from a single viewpoint.\nAnomaly detection in electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) spectra enhances security, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and safety. It also helps detect hidden threats, wildfires, pollution, and equipment failures. This technology improves awareness, enables early warnings, and supports better decision-making.\n\"As a global technology leader, Lockheed Martin is collaborating with Spanish industry to drive innovation and transformation, strengthen deterrence, and foster a dynamic ecosystem for dual-use technologies,\" said Emanuele Serafini, Lockheed Martin's West Europe vice president. \"Our work with Arquimea is on a pivotal research and development initiative, driving advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which supports Spain's involvement in the development of these cutting-edge technologies.\"\nIn a series of demonstrations, the Skunk Works\u00ae and Arquimea team simulated a small uncrewed air system (UAS) flying through a jungle environment, identifying changes to physical features based on episodic memories trained into neural networks.\nThe system created unique views of the environment, even when the UAS had not previously observed the scene from a given angle. Stored memories are compared to new observations, and changes are analysed using machine learning to detect important irregularities.\nThis approach allows ISR platforms to do more than just compare images and helps AI systems handle situations they've never encountered before, supporting trustworthy AI. It also applies to autonomous flight and search algorithms.\nBuilding on this progress, in 2025 Skunk Works\u00ae and Arquimea will explore how these techniques can improve other sensors and decision-making for autonomous systems.\n\"Skunk Works is dedicated to enabling crewed-uncrewed teaming to optimize operational flexibility, abbreviate data-to-decision timelines and improve pilot safety,\" said OJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager, Skunk Works. \"We continue to invest in collaborative enablers to keep our customers ahead of emerging threats.\"\nAbout Lockheed Martin\nLockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery.

The flight was conducted in October by a Rockwell Sabreliner 65 testbed equipped with a pod carrying the sensor.\nIn an emailed statement, the company says it is \u201cdemonstrating capability readiness before the scheduled customer\u2011evaluation window in 2026.\u201d In January 2025 Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract to equip the F-22 Raptor with TacIRST, and the company confirmed to us that the initial customer integration will indeed be with the F\u201122.\nTacIRST\nTacIRST, or Tactical Infrared Search and Track, is a next-generation sensor developed by Lockheed Martin which allows to detect and track airborne threats with weapon-quality accuracy, says the company. The system provides 360\u2011degree situational awareness, passively detecting and tracking both surface\u2011to\u2011air and air\u2011to\u2011air threats.\nThe company told us the Gen III TacIRST builds on the proven architecture of earlier TacIRST prototypes while incorporating a suite of SWAP\u2011C (Size, Weight, Power, and Cost) improvements. Improving SWAP-C allows to obtain a more compact, less power-hungry system which can easily be integrated on aircraft without requiring extensive modification.\nAdditionally, the system is designed with open mission standards to integrate seamlessly with existing host platforms and enhance missile\u2011warning capability. This ensures compatibility with a range of platforms, including fixed\u2011wing fighters and large aircraft, says Lockheed Martin.\nCompared to traditional IRST which features round windows, TacIRST is based on a smaller staring sensor much more similar to the windows of the F-35\u2019s Distributed Aperture System. Similarly to DAS, TacIRST supports integration with Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMS) to provide pilots with rapid threat indication, as well as targeting functions to support beyond\u2011visual\u2011range missile engagements.\nLockheed Martin further says TacIRST builds on the hardware and software expertise gained from fielding IRST\u201121 and the AN/AAR-56 F\u201122 Missile Launch Detector (MLD) system. The former is itself the evolution of the company\u2019s legacy AN/AAS-42 IRST sensor system, which accumulated over 300,000 flight hours on F-14 and international F-15 platforms.\nTacIRST and F-22\nLockheed Martin announced on Jan. 22, 2025, that it has been awarded a $270 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to integrate a system of next-generation infrared defensive sensors on the F-22 Raptor. The system, known as the Infrared Defensive System (IRDS), will add a distributed set of embedded TacIRST sensors to enhance the F-22\u2019s survivability and lethality.\n\u201cWe understand the need for advanced and versatile infrared systems like IRDS that will make pilots\u2019 missions more survivable and lethal against current and future adversaries,\u201d said on that occasion Hank Tucker, Vice President of Missions Systems at Lockheed Martin. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting the Air Force through continuous innovation of capabilities to deter and defeat evolving threats.\u201d\nIt is unclear if TacIRST will be integrated directly in the Raptor\u2019s airframe, although the description as a distributed set of embedded sensors and the SWAP-C improvements appear to suggest so. The fact that TacIRST uses small staring sensors would make it ideal for installation on the F-22 as the sensors would be flush with the surfaces of the aircraft.\nIn the past, there were unconfirmed reports about the technology behind TacIRST possibly being related to upgrades to the F-22\u2019s current AN/AAR-56 Missile Launch Detector (MLD). Given the sensitivity of the F-22 program, the statement released in January did not delve into details, so it is unclear if the IRDS will completely replace the AAR-56 or just its sensors.\nThe F-22 is receiving a plethora of upgrades as part of an improvement campaign that calls for $7.8 billion in investments before 2030, which includes $3.1 billion for research and development and $4.7 billion in procurement. While the Air Force previously planned to retire the oldest Raptors, the service now appears to be reconsidering that plan and focusing on sustaining an air superiority combat capability for a highly contested environment.\nAs part of the upgrades, an F-22 has been spotted at the Air Force\u2019s Plant 42 facility in Palmdale, California, with two pods installed under the outer underwing hardpoints in February 2022. Budget documents mentioned an InfraRed Search and Track (IRST) sensor being developed for the F-22, which appears now confirmed to be the type of sensor housed inside the two pods.\nIt is unclear if these pods might have any relation with TacIRST, although they could host the sensors distributed around the aircraft to provide a 360-degrees cover. However, the pods could also host a more powerful IRST specifically for long-range targeting or other capabilities.\nIn July 2024 we got an up-close look at one of the pods installed under a Rockwell Sabreliner 65 testbed after a test campaign at Nellis AFB, Nevada. It would have been expected to see some kind of transparent surface associated with the IRST, however the surfaces on the nose of the pod appeared to be opaque. We still cannot exclude that there are two different variants of the pod, depending on the equipment inside."

    "content": "The U.S. Air Force has now denied taking delivery of any F-35A Joint Strike Fighters from the latest Lot 17 production batch without radars installed. This comes a day after TWZ published a detailed piece examining a recent unconfirmed report that the U.S. military has been receiving radar-less F-35s since last June due to issues tied to the new AN/APG-85 radar. Earlier this week, the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) had declined to confirm or deny whether that was the case, citing \u201cenhanced security measures.\u201d\n\u201cUSAF F-35A lot 17 aircraft are delivering with APG-81 radars,\u201d an Air Force spokesperson told TWZ today in an unprompted statement. \u201cThe Air Force is working with the F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office to deliver F-35s with APG-85 radars, and actual modernization plans, capabilities, and schedules remain classified to maintain program security.\u201d\nSince at least 2023, Northrop Grumman has been developing the APG-85 as a replacement for the existing AN/APG-81 radar used on all F-35 variants. The new radar is one part of the larger critical Block 4 upgrade package, which has been beset by delays and cost growth. Block 4 is also supposed to eventually include replacements for the Joint Strike Fighter\u2019s AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS) and Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), as well as a new electronic warfare suite and a host of other improved capabilities. In the past, the Air Force has described the electronic warfare package, which will be directly tied in with the APG-85, as a top priority.\n\u201cLockheed Martin has been delivering F-35s to the military services since last June without radars, including all F-35As,\u201d Defense Daily had reported last week, citing an anonymous source. \u201cF-35 deliveries to U.S. units in the field since last June have had the APG-85 mountings, which do not fit the APG-81.\u201d\n\u201cThe radar-less F-35 deliveries have not affected sales to foreign partner nations which have the APG-81 on their jets, the source said,\u201d that story added. \u201cWithout a radar, there had to be additional weight added in the nose for aircraft balance during flight. Radar-less F-35s have been able to fly, as long as they are accompanied by other F-35s, data linked and equipped with the APG-81, the source said.\u201d\nAs mentioned, TWZ reached out earlier this week to the F-35 JPO with queries regarding the details in the Defense Daily piece.\n\u201cF-35 Lightning II aircraft are being built to accommodate the F-35 advanced radar (APG-85) for [the] U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps,\u201d an F-35 JPO spokesperson had told us in response. \u201cInitial fielding for some F-35 aircraft is planned for Lot 17, which began delivery in 2025 and continues through September 2026.\u201d\n\u201cDue to program security reasons, we are protecting any additional information with enhanced security measures,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nIn addition, Defense Daily\u2018s report last week said it received a statement from the Air Force that was similar to the response we subsequently received from the JPO.\n\u201cThis advanced radar [APG-85] will be compatible with all variants of the F-35 aircraft,\u201d an Air Force spokesperson told that outlet. \u201cDue to program security reasons, we are protecting any additional information with enhanced security measures.\u201d\nWhat has now changed regarding these \u201cenhanced security measures\u201d and why is unclear. There are still questions from our story yesterday that remain unanswered, including whether or not jets configured to accept the APG-85 can have the APG-81 installed for the time being. If modifications are required for this, it is not clear how substantial or invasive they might need to be. As we previously noted, a separate report last year from Breaking Defense had also pointed to a backwards compatibility issue and potential need to redesign the entire forward end of the fuselage to be able to accommodate both the APG-81 and the APG-85.\nTWZ has followed up with the Air Force to see if more information may now be available.\nAs we detailed in our piece yesterday, there are additional questions about the general status of work on the APG-85 and the rest of the Block 4 upgrade package, and the timeline now for the delivery of any of those capabilities. The integration of the APG-85, as well as the new electronic warfare suite and many of the other improvements, are all directly intertwined with the need for more auxiliary power-generation and thermal cooling capacity. These demands are supposed to be addressed, at least in part, by an engine upgrade effort that is itself now running behind schedule.\nThe goal had previously been for F-35s with a complete suite of Block 4 improvements to begin arriving this year. A September 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, said that those plans had been revised to focus first on a truncated portion of the upgrade package, but that schedule had still been set back at least five years.\nThe F-35 program continues to stare down growing costs associated with operating and maintaining the jets. Altogether, the total cost of the program from the start of development in the 1990s through the end of the type\u2019s expected lifecycle in the 2070s, is now estimated to be approximtely $2.1 trillion. The JPO has stressed that inflation is expected to account for roughly half of that figure.\nAltogether, even if F-35s are not being delivered now without radars, there are still significant challenges facing the Block 4 upgrade package and the rest of the Joint Strike Fighter program.\nContact the author: joe@twz.com"

The Netherlands is upgrading its Puma All Environment (AE) small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and procuring larger Puma Long Endurance (LE) UASs, the Dutch Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced on its website on 19 March. The contract was signed with US company AeroVironment in Utrecht, the Netherlands, earlier the same day. Dutch Puma AE block II UASs will be upgraded to block III standard, which the MoD said can operate in areas in which global navigation satellite services are denied. Other capabilities will be improved and the UAS will receive a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) kit. Planning calls for the upgraded UASs to be delivered in 2025 and to be operational at the squad and platoon levels later in the year and at the company level probably in 2026, according to the Dutch MoD. The Netherlands will also receive Puma LE UASs with a longer range than the Puma AE. The Dutch MoD noted that Puma is used mainly for reconnaissance and that the small UAS collects detailed up-to-date information during operations, improving situational awareness of large areas and providing early warning of dangerous situations such as blocked routes or suspect vehicles. The UASs can also be used for civilian tasks, the Dutch MoD said. Puma can be operated by individual infantry soldiers and from Fennek armoured reconnaissance vehicles, with the ministry aiming for all reconnaissance units to be equipped with the UAS. The Puma upgrade is part of a wider Royal Netherlands Army plan to increase UAS capabilities, which the Dutch MoD expects to contribute to the service\u2019s modernisation and improved effectiveness.

    "summary": "Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology Center demonstrated an innovative perimeter security system called VAMS for government and commercial applications. The system utilizes commercial hardware and software with proprietary Lockheed Martin elements to detect intrusions, including stationary objects, multiple intruders, and air-dropped items. VAMS is designed to be difficult to spoof compared to traditional security technologies and can also be used indoors.",

    "content": "Releases\nScientists and engineers at the Lockheed Martin\n\"We developed this system in response to needs articulated by the US Government,\" said Dr. Vibeke Libby, principal scientist at the ATC and inventor of VAMS. \"Our goal was to create a robust and versatile system that offers an affordable solution to new challenges for perimeter security. Our close partnership with Intelleflex is ideal. We have been able to combine our companies' proprietary technologies resulting in an unprecedented range of new capabilities. For example, VAMS will detect stationary objects, single or multiple intruders, air-dropped items, left-behind items, and even intruders who vault perimeter fences or drop by parachute. As an intrusion is detected, a camera is automatically cued and pointed at the intrusion coordinates for operator alarm and verification.\"\n\"The Advanced Technology Center at Lockheed Martin has developed a truly innovative security application that leverages the unique capabilities of Intelleflex's new XC3 products,\" said Peter Mehring, president and CEO of Intelleflex. \"It has been a pleasure to work with Dr. Libby and her team, as their development fully realized the potential of the XC3's robust RF capabilities, which include 100-meter response range while adhering to the new ISO 18000-6 Class 3 Standard.\"\nDue to a complex mix of possible emergencies, including terrorist attacks, accidents, and natural disasters, security protection of borders and critical infrastructures is a major imperative for the US Government. Increased security can be achieved through a layered approach of prevention, protection and preparedness. The VAMS security system provides one such layer.\nThe automated wireless VAMS alarm system can be rapidly deployed as a stand-alone long-life, greater than two years, battery-supported security system. It comprises a field of sensors that exchange information with a power source. The signal quality is persistent and predictable in an unperturbed environment and when perturbed convincingly produces a recognizable signature.\nBy exploiting Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology from Intelleflex, VAMS is able to achieve a high level of security by providing volumetric protection at a competitive performance to cost ratio. The system is extremely difficult to spoof or defeat, unlike fence-based security systems, which can be circumvented by jumping, bridging, or digging. VAMS can detect intrusions in three dimensions as well as accurately locate moving and stationary objects. The long-life sensors can be placed anywhere in the field with little or no geometrical constraints.\nA human intruder will affect one or more communication channels in the vicinity of an intrusion point. An object or a human does not need to be in the direct communication path to affect the communication of a sensor. In fact, the disturbance is likely to affect several sensors in a protected area to varying degrees dependent on the relative position of intruder and sensors. This variation is used to determine the number of intrusions and their location.\nVAMS can also be used indoors. Testing has confirmed that the system can detect nightly movements, room entries, including small robotic devices, and left behind items in should-be-closed areas. In protection of a soldiers' camp, sensors can be placed in a 325-foot radius around the antennas. As movements take place, the sensors report the movement to the camp command center. For other applications, the detection range can be extended by increasing the antenna output power above the one-watt required for FCC compliance.\nIn a field demonstration, the RF system integrated seamlessly with a field camera with slew and zoom capability. The demonstration showed that data can be analyzed in real-time and alarms issued only 1-2 seconds after an intrusion was initiated. In a control room-like setting, the participants could follow the activities in the field, switch to manual mode for intrusion verification, and check system status.\nVAMS can detect both stationary and slow moving persons regardless of clothing or protective gear. Compared to current security systems, the VAMS-camera combination can detect and verify intrusions designed to spoof traditional technologies, like motion, infrared, pressure, or security cameras. VAMS therefore poses a serious challenge to sophisticated intruders.\nIntelleflex <www.intelleflex.com> is the leader in Extended Capability RFID solutions, products, and technologies. Intelleflex's passive XC1 and battery assisted passive XC3 technologies enable solutions for asset tracking, cold chain management, vehicle/yard management, manufacturing WIP control, supply chain automation, parts maintenance, access control, and other applications.\nThe ATC is the research and development organization of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC). LMSSC, a major operating unit of Lockheed Martin Corporation, designs and develops, tests, manufactures and operates a full spectrum of advanced-technology systems for national security and military, civil government and commercial customers.

Known as AzaleaTM, the group of satellites will use a range of sensors to collect visual, radar and radio frequency (RF) data, which will be analysed by on board machine learning on edge processors to deliver the resulting intelligence securely, anywhere in the world while still in orbit.\nFollowing the acquisition of In-Space Missions last year, BAE Systems is one of a small number of British companies with the capability to design, build, launch and operate satellites. The expertise brought by In-Space Missions complements the Company\u2019s existing advanced technologies and will become an integral part of its multi-domain capability. AzaleaTM will also boost the UK\u2019s ability to understand the threats and hazards in, from and through space.\nThe AzaleaTM cluster will deliver timely, actionable intelligence, essential for military operations and disaster response. Comprising four highly resilient satellites which, together, are capable of gathering, analysing and communicating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical and RF signals. Unlike conventional, single-purpose satellites, the cluster can be fully reconfigured whilst in orbit in the same way a smartphone installs a new app; this ensures it can deliver future customer missions and expands the lifecycle of the satellites.\nThe programme supports the UK Government\u2019s Defence Space Strategy, published earlier this year, which named Earth observation as a priority area to help protect and defend UK interests, a sovereign capability which AzaleaTM could provide.\nBAE Systems is working with Finnish firm, ICEYE, to combine its own expertise in sensor technology with ICEYE\u2019s advanced SAR technology to be included in the cluster. SAR provides high-resolution imagery of the Earth\u2019s surface, day or night and in any weather conditions. This persistent monitoring makes it easier to detect instant physical changes, such as the movement of hostile ships or aircraft or the location of people at risk during natural disasters, such as floods and forest fires.\nExisting space-based sensors require multiple terabytes of data to be transferred to Earth before being processed and distributed. The traditional transfer process can take many hours and is reliant on intermittent RF links and the availability of suitable ground stations. The AzaleaTM system saves valuable time by combining and analysing data in space. It will be able to identify activities of interest and directly communicate with users on the ground within moments of detection \u2013 securely delivering assured data, in a useful timeframe, directly to the hands of decision makers.\nDave Armstrong, Group Managing Director of BAE Systems\u2019 Digital Intelligence business said: \u201cThe AzaleaTM satellite cluster will process data in space to provide swathes of digital intelligence wherever it\u2019s needed. We understand how important space-based intelligence is to every domain, whether that\u2019s informing strategic command, alerting an in area warship, or providing real-time intelligence to forces on the ground. The launch of AzaleaTM in 2024 will be a major step forward for the UK\u2019s sovereign space capability.\u201d\nRafal Modrzewski, CEO and Co-founder of ICEYE, added: \u201cICEYE helps to solve problems using data. There is a clear advantage for governments and organisations to receive accurate information when they need it, regardless of weather conditions \u2013 this is what ICEYE brings. By combining our SAR technology with the security expertise of BAE Systems and the other data sources in the cluster, we can help decision makers make the right choice at the right time.\u201d\nDoug Liddle, Chief Executive and co-founder of In-Space Missions, said: \u201cWe\u2019re working together to create a step-change in military intelligence and capabilities. Our technology will monitor adversaries, but will also provide substantial civil benefits by helping humanitarian response missions.\u201d\nImage courtesy BAE Systems"

More generally, with advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there are ever-growing discussions around the employment of increasingly autonomous weapon systems, something that TWZ has previously highlighted. At the same time, some kind of swarming capability is also likely to be central to the way the UAS operates.\nBroadly speaking, the new UAS appears to follow a similar format to Lockheed Martin\u2019s Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT, pronounced \u2018comet\u2019), which is shown in concept artwork with pop-out wings. An earlier rendering of the CMMT, presented below, showed it with a V-shaped tail assembly and an unusual single offset air intake. There is no visible air intake in the renderings for the new UAS.\nWhen more details about the CMMT were announced earlier this year, Lockheed Martin described it as a family of systems, comprised of low-cost subsonic air vehicles designed for a wide range of missions and for launch from both air and ground platforms.\nAs for the new Lockheed Martin/BAE Systems UAS, this is described as being \u201crapidly deployable and modular to deliver a range of effects, including disruptive capabilities.\u201d In the first instance, however, the UAS will be configured for electronic warfare and electronic attack. In this role, it is intended to be used to enhance the survivability of crewed combat aircraft. Like the CMMT, the new UAS will also come with multiple launch options.\nThe Lockheed Martin/BAE Systems UAS reflects a number of key trends that can be seen across designs that increasingly blur the line between uncrewed aerial systems, especially longer-range kamikaze drones, and cruise missiles, as well as decoys and other \u2018launched effects.\u2019\nTo start with, the two firms are hopeful that the new UAS can be brought into production quickly, leveraging the potential of Skunk Works and FalconWorks to rapidly design, prototype, and then build defense products.\nOnce ready for series production, the resulting UAS should be cost-effective and easily deployable. This will ensure that manufacturing output can be ramped up to meet the demands of future large-scale conflicts and that the UAS should be affordable enough to be fielded in significant numbers to boost \u2018combat mass.\u2019 The ability to produce munitions at scale is something that is increasingly seen as a key requirement by the U.S. military, and elsewhere.\nWhile it looks very much like a missile, the manufacturers classify the new vehicle more as a drone, reflecting the growing demand for uncrewed assets of different varieties to complement crewed platforms.\nBAE Systems also stresses that the new UAS should be able to work alongside existing crewed platforms and not just the next (sixth) generation of combat jets.\nHaving a drone/munition/launched effect that offers modularity is also increasingly on-trend. In this way, the same common design can be adapted to fly different missions. While electronic warfare/electronic attack is clearly the first priority, it\u2019s easy to envisage subsequent iterations of the UAS being configured for kinetic attack, with the design evolving into a relatively cheap cruise missile. By switching out the payloads, it could also be used for intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR), as well as being employed as a decoy.\nIn terms of launch options, BAE Systems outlines plans for the initial system to be suitable for air drop, ground launch, and maritime launch. In addition to air drop, the company notes that the UAS will also be able to be launched \u201cfrom a wide-body logistic aircraft.\u201d\nThat latter concept parallels the U.S. military\u2019s Rapid Dragon, an experimental effort in which airlifters have been armed with cruise missiles. Having palletized munitions aboard an airlifter is now being seen as a critical way of boosting air-launched strike capabilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to join forces with BAE Systems, combining our expertise in rapid prototyping and advanced development to deliver game-changing capabilities,\u201d said OJ Sanchez, Vice President and General Manager, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, in a press release. \u201cBy working together, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our customers and advancing the future of autonomous systems.\u201d\nDave Holmes, Managing Director of BAE Systems\u2019 FalconWorks division, added that the new UAS program will \u201cdeliver disruptive capabilities that can make a real difference to our military customers at pace, enabling them to confront the operational requirements of today\u2019s battlefield.\u201d\nWhile key performance and other parameters of the new UAS remain unknown, the design appears to be very much in keeping with an ongoing U.S. Air Force push for cheaper, easier-to-produce munitions that has been accelerated by the realities of the current stockpile and its limited depth.\nWhile this appears to be a new area of focus for BAE Systems, it\u2019s notable that Lockheed Martin has been working in this field for some time, beyond the aforementioned CMMT.\nIn fact, the CMMT is a revised design based on the same company\u2019s Speed Racer air vehicle concept, a missile-shaped uncrewed system you can read more about here.\nThe older Lockheed Martin video below includes a rendering of the Speed Racer experimental vehicle, as seen in the thumbnail.\nBack in 2022, Lockheed Martin unveiled four distinct uncrewed aircraft designs, one of which was the CMMT, with Speed Racer being disclosed as the basis for it.\nLike the new UAS being developed with BAE Systems, the CMMT is designed to be suitable for air-drop from fighters, bombers, and transports, with previous concept artwork showing examples being launched from a C-130 series airlifter (as seen at the top of this story) and from an F-16 fighter. There is also a smaller version of the CMMT that comprises a long-range launched effect that will be deployed from rotary-wing platforms \u2014 related concept artwork has shown an H-60 Black Hawk series helicopter.\nLockheed Martin also showed concept artwork of a ground-launched version of the CMMT, with an example being fired from an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) using one of its rocket pods. The fact that the new Lockheed Martin/BAE Systems UAS is also intended to be offered for ground launch could indicate that HIMARS is a possible launch platform, although much will depend on the size of the vehicle. Regardless, a supplementary booster would presumably be required for ground launch.\nAt this stage, we don\u2019t know what, if any, relationship the new UAS might have with the CMMT, or other Lockheed Martin efforts, although it would appear almost certainly planned to leverage the same rapid path to manufacturing. In the past, the U.S. firm has talked about the aim of producing a low-cost design that is \u201c100 percent producible from the start.\u201d Then, once a scalable product is achieved, \u201cperformance-enhancing and mission-specific capabilities\u201d will be introduced later, \u201cas use cases and threats emerge.\u201d\nOverall, Lockheed Martin\u2019s previously known efforts in this direction also find parallels with other manufacturers. For example, Anduril\u2019s Barracuda is described as a new family of \u201cexpendable autonomous air vehicles\u201d that are scalable, highly modular, and already being flight tested. Other entrants in what is fast becoming a crowded field include the L3Harris Red Wolf and Green Wolf, and these represent just a portion of the low-cost precision munition projects known to be going on now in the United States.\nThere are, meanwhile, an increasing number of cheaper cruise missiles now in the works, and this is an area that has attracted particular interest from smaller firms, including some brand-new players that pose a challenge to Lockheed Martin and others.\nWith the eyes of the Pentagon very much on a potential conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific region, and the demands for low-cost air vehicles that this would entail, the Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems collaboration is nothing if not timely. Involving the U.K.-based company could well open the door to additional export opportunities for the new, unnamed uncrewed air system. Meanwhile, the prospect of two defense-contracting powerhouses teaming up will be hard to overlook as the Pentagon and its allies start to pour more money into this space.\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com"

    "content": "Lockheed Martin Leverages AI and Machine Learning to Revolutionize Defense and Space Technology\nAs the United States and allies face an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, Lockheed Martin\u2019s leadership in evolving and transforming for the future is more important than ever. That\u2019s why the corporation prioritizes and invests in the most advanced technologies including in Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). AI and ML are key tenets of Lockheed Martin\u2019s 21st Century Security vision \u2013 not only in utilizing AI/ML, but enabling it at scale to support customers\u2019 critical missions.\nOne of Lockheed Martin\u2019s latest projects in the AI/ML space is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s (DARPA) Artificial Intelligence Reinforcements \u2013 or \u201cAIR\u201d \u2013 program. DARPA recently awarded Lockheed Martin the AIR contract to develop AI tools for dynamic, airborne missions to achieve dominant airborne tactical autonomy. The AIR program aims to provide advanced Modeling and Simulation (M&S) approaches and dominant AI agents for live, multi-ship, beyond visual range (BVR) missions.\u201d\nIn support of this, Lockheed Martin has offered a solution concentrated on the development of advanced M&S capabilities using AI-driven models to deliver faster and more accurate results enabling rapid training of AI agents. Lockheed Martin\u2019s ARISE\u2122 capability standardizes M&S and utilizes AI to enable the processing of large volumes of data. This provides large cost savings for the Department of Defense and enables us to provide enhanced capabilities to the warfighter.\n\u201cWhen creating AI, you need to generate and test on vast amounts of data in high-fidelity simulations,\u201d said Jason Luck, a senior fellow specializing in AI and autonomy at Lockheed Martin. \u201cUnfortunately, higher fidelity goes hand in hand with higher processing demands and longer run times. The capabilities developed on DARPA AIR will advance ARISE to enable extremely rapid testing of products during development and to rapidly upgrade our products to meet the urgent needs of our customers. We are also looking at other ways the advanced capabilities developed on DARPA AIR can be used within ARISE and across the corporation.\"\nAnother way Lockheed Martin is using AI is through aircraft inspection of potential anomalies. This is an important factor in helping to reduce maintenance costs and improve safety. This technology can potentially apply across the corporation to inspect various aircraft types.\nLockheed Martin is working closely with customers to ensure AI models are trusted by the end-user to meet their mission needs. This is especially true with Lockheed Martin\u2019s use of AI/ML in support of the U.S. Navy's Aegis Combat System. AL/ML helps the system assess threats and make decisions based on data. Already, this technology has helped make updates for destroyers to counter Houthi attacks.\nLockheed Martin remains committed to advancing state-of-the-art autonomous systems in support of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) effort. The Skunk Works\u00ae team is hard at work, prioritizing speed to ramp and delivering quantity at scale to realize the Air Force vision of autonomous systems working synergistically with crewed and uncrewed systems to provide the ultimate in mission flexibility as part of a distributed team. Our work to develop and integrate pathfinding open architectures, ground control systems like the MDCX\u2122 and mission systems continues. For some time, we\u2019ve been focused on bringing to life the transformative power of autonomous and AI-enabled operations in crewed and uncrewed Department of Defense systems, with particular focus on integrating fifth generation aircraft. This commitment and work are ongoing.\nOne of the future\u2019s biggest challenges is data. Even now humans alone can\u2019t make sense of -- or make quick decisions from -- all the sensor data they receive. Lockheed Martin is taking on this challenge by demonstrating how AI can analyze multiple, diverse data streams to create a prototype Earth and Space Observing Digital Twin of current global weather conditions for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Technology like this could provide greater situational awareness for many of the company\u2019s other customers.\nLockheed Martin is also already using AI for spacecraft monitoring and control. As part of a company-funded demo to show how space can enhance Combined Joint All-Domain Command & Control (CJADC2), AI is autonomously monitoring spacecraft telemetry for two Pony Express 2 mission smallsats. An AI application onboard both satellites -- called Telemetry Analytics for Universal Artificial Intelligence (T-TAURI) -- has the ability to predict potential failures faster than humans, allowing controllers to stay ahead of ready for issues before they occur.\nThese are just a few examples of how Lockheed Martin is leveraging the power of AI and ML to support its customers, and there are sure to be many more exciting developments to come.\n\u201cAt Lockheed Martin, our AI capabilities are designed to help customers complete their missions with greater speed, accuracy and safety,\u201d said Dr. Steven Walker, chief technology officer at Lockheed Martin. \u201cAcross the corporation, we\u2019ve invested heavily in AI \u2013 not only in the tools that build AI but in specific capabilities across all domains. We offer an open AI platform that others can build on so that our service members can have the capabilities they need when and where they need it most.\u201d\nWith its expertise in AI and ML, Lockheed Martin is well-positioned to continue leading the way in defense and space technology for 21st Century Security\u00ae solutions. As AI and ML continue to advance, Lockheed Martin will find even more ways to support its customers and contribute to the security and prosperity of the U.S. and its allies."

But AI can be trained specifically to separate signal from noise in a given environment.\nAn AI-powered system can become an expert in the area around a military base, for example, learning the local landscape, structures, and even weather patterns so it knows how to pick out and track drone anomalies with exceptional accuracy.\nAI can match defensive weapons to drone targets much faster than humans: Once the drone is spotted, a counter-UAS system has to know how to best determine intent and to plan for mitigation. But that depends on many complex factors. Is the drone carrying explosives? Is it vulnerable to a cyber or electronic attack? Could a laser take it down safely?\nFor operators in a command center, making those decisions from a dozen or so football fields away can cost precious minutes. But an AI algorithm can be trained to recognize and evaluate different drone threats in an instant, evaluating its weaknesses and capabilities to quickly find and recommend the best way to maintain safety and sovereignty. It can also be trained on policy and rules of engagement to know which responses best align to regulations, assisting operators in a complex data rich environment.\nAI might be the only way to move fast enough to repel a drone swarm: In a large swarm scenario, human operators can be quickly overwhelmed. A well-trained AI system, governed by robust safety protocols, could take over defenses, rapidly prioritizing and engaging drones to stave off a powerful assault. Such a defense would require layering offensive and defensive tactics, a feat only an AI-powered system could likely pull off.\nBuilding an Intelligent Counter-UAS Network\nSanctum\u2122, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Counter-UAS system, is proving out those AI-driven capabilities in joint exercises worldwide. From precision tracking and targeting to real-world takedowns of drone threats, Sanctum is demonstrating the power of smart, layered defense.\nSanctum is customized for each deployment, using a combination of layered defensive systems and a core AI mission management system that is trained to detect drones in cluttered environments, track them with confidence, and identify the level of threat they pose. The system then recommends the ideal weapon-target pairing to take them out quickly and safely.\nSanctum\u2019s AI is a learning algorithm. What Sanctum sees in one location trains the system everywhere. When Sanctum tracks a new threat or recognizes a different UAS behavior, it shares those updates across the network. That makes each node smarter, and helps keep Sanctum-equipped defenses ahead of the threat.\nThat software is built on the same Lockheed Martin-designed air and missile defense technology like the Aegis Combat System that\u2019s countering drone and cruise missile threats in places like the Red Sea. From sensors and sensor fusion to automated weapon-target pairing and precision intercepts, these technologies are battle-tested, not just beta-tested.\nWe combine that AI mission management brain with a mix of the top-performing sensors and effectors from across the commercial and defense tech industry. Sanctum\u2019s open architecture means there\u2019s no vendor lock and no requirement to use Lockheed Martin tech. Each defensive network is built for what the mission needs, from software to sensors to shooters. And as new innovations come online, Sanctum can integrate new tech with ease.\nThe result is a system that\u2019s custom-designed and diligently trained to defend each unique location. That delivers more effective security, with better chances of seeing and stopping drones in their tracks without risking the safety of a base or the surrounding area.\nSanctum gives operators a decisive edge over a rapidly evolving drone threat.\nPaul Lemmo is the Vice President and General Manager of Integrated Warfare Systems and Sensors at Lockheed Martin."

That way, users can schedule when they do their maintenance while they have all the parts and support equipment in place to do that [maintenance].\u201d\nHercFusion introduces 5th generation sustainment capabilities, enabling operators to transition from unscheduled to scheduled maintenance practices.\nEvery C-130J Super Hercules is equipped with 600 sensors, collectively generating 3GB of data per flight hour. HercFusion meticulously analyzes this extensive dataset, employing advanced algorithms to forecast part replacement requirements. This proactive approach allows maintenance teams to strategically position spare parts, ensuring uninterrupted aircraft operation. Customers can more effectively plan for deployments with the help of this information.\nMike Isbill said, \u201cIt lets operators know what they need to take in their pack-up kits, because they know the health of that aircraft when they get ready to deploy.\u201d\nThe implementation of this predictive maintenance model demonstrates a notable 3% rise in mission capability rate.\n\u201cThat may seem like a small number but it actually can represent having a completely extra aircraft in your fleet, It\u2019s huge cost savings, it\u2019s an aircraft they didn\u2019t have to buy, it\u2019s parts they don\u2019t have to buy. We\u2019re getting more up-time for the customer, at lower cost to them and a safer aircraft for the crew.\u201d, said Isbill.\nOne HercFusion operator experienced a substantial 15% decrease in fuel consumption.\nIsbill said, \u201cWe\u2019re able to reduce some of their maintenance time, and they\u2019ve actually seen about a 15% reduction in fuel usage, so a cost savings, saving to the environment, and the goal is to continue to improve that mission capable rate. The less time the aircraft is down having to do maintenance \u2014 especially if it\u2019s troubleshooting you really don\u2019t need to do because our AI can tell you don\u2019t need to do it \u2014 is a huge benefit.\u201d\nWhat Comes Next\nIn an ever-evolving battlespace, the team continues to leverage AI technology to aid customers in completing missions with increased speed, accuracy, and safety. Currently, the team is striving to integrate machine learning and AI tools onto aircraft, aiming to enhance onboard capabilities.\n- As aircraft depart, operators will carry the tool with them, enabling them to feed data back to the base through 5g.mil. This data can then be reviewed by base maintainers in nearly real-time, facilitating prompt analysis and decision-making.\n- \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have bases in permanent places; you\u2019re going to have bases that have to move. You have to be able to know where the parts need to be, when [the parts] need to be there, and then get [the parts] on and out as quickly as possible,\u201d stated by Isbill.\nThrough modifications to the data and operational settings, these algorithms are versatile enough to suit various aircraft models. The team\u2019s broader goal is to extend the use of this machine learning and AI technology to additional platforms and products.\nAlso Read \u2013 Lilium, SEGULA Partner on Certification Test Facility for Lilium Jet\nIsbill said, \u201cEvery day we move forward, we create new algorithms, we create improvements to the algorithms we have. We get closer and closer to getting that downtime to where it\u2019s just removing the parts you need to remove, put the new one on and go.\u201d\nQ. \u2013 What is HercFusion?\nA. \u2013 HercFusion is a suite of tools utilizing AI to optimize aircraft maintenance, particularly for the C-130J Super Hercules.\nQ. \u2013 What data does HercFusion analyze?\nA. \u2013 HercFusion analyzes data from 3 million C-130J flight hours, including information from 600 sensors generating 3GB of data per flight hour."

HercFusion keeps fleets airborne in support of missions around the world.\nWhat it Means\nHercFusion provides C-130J operators with machine-learning results that inform maintainers in how to better maintain the aircraft, resulting in:\n- Improved availability of the aircraft\n- Increased mission capability of the aircraft\n- Reduced cost over time\n\u201cHercFusion allows the maintenance ops team and the flight ops team to look at the health of an aircraft, down to the part level, and determine the best aircraft to deploy,\u201d said Mike Isbill, Lockheed Martin Technical Fellow who specializes in Digital Sustainment Analytics. \u201cThat way, users can schedule when they do their maintenance while they have all the parts and support equipment in place to do that [maintenance].\u201d\nHercFusion brings 5th generation sustainment to the user, allowing operators to shift from unscheduled to scheduled maintenance.\nData Matters\nEach C-130J Super Hercules has 600 sensors that generate 3GB of data per flight hour.\nHercFusion analyzes all of that data and uses algorithms to predict when a part needs to be replaced so that maintenance can preposition spares to keep aircraft up and running.\nThese insights allow customers to better plan for deployments.\n\u201cIt lets operators know what they need to take in their pack-up kits, because they know the health of that aircraft when they get ready to deploy,\u201d Isbill said.\nBy the Numbers\nThis predictive maintenance model shows a 3% increase in mission capability rate.\n- \u201cThat may seem like a small number but it actually can represent having a completely extra aircraft in your fleet,\u201d Isbill said. \u201cIt\u2019s huge cost savings, it\u2019s an aircraft they didn\u2019t have to buy, it\u2019s parts they don\u2019t have to buy. We\u2019re getting more up-time for the customer, at lower cost to them and a safer aircraft for the crew.\u201d\nOne HercFusion operator reported about a 15% reduction in fuel usage.\n- \u201cWe\u2019re able to reduce some of their maintenance time, and they\u2019ve actually seen about a 15% reduction in fuel usage, so a cost savings, saving to the environment, and the goal is to continue to improve that mission capable rate,\u201d Isbill said. \u201cThe less time the aircraft is down having to do maintenance \u2014 especially if it\u2019s troubleshooting you really don\u2019t need to do because our AI can tell you don\u2019t need to do it \u2014 is a huge benefit.\u201d\nWhat's Next\nIn an ever-evolving battlespace, our team continues to leverage AI technology to help our customers complete missions with enhanced speed, accuracy and safety. Now, the team is working to compact the machine learning and the AI tool to actually go on the aircraft.\n- When aircraft fly away, the operators will take that tool with them. Our team will then feed the data back to the base using 5g.mil, where the maintainers on base will be able to review it in almost real-time.\n- \"You\u2019re not going to have bases in permanent places; you\u2019re going to have bases that have to move. You have to be able to know where the parts need to be, when [the parts] need to be there, and then get [the parts] on and out as quickly as possible,\u201d Isbill said.\nBy adjusting the data and operating environments, these algorithms can work for any aircraft and the team aims to apply this machine learning and AI to other platforms and products.\n- \u201cEvery day we move forward, we create new algorithms, we create improvements to the algorithms we have,\u201d Isbill said. \u201cWe get closer and closer to getting that downtime to where it\u2019s just removing the parts you need to remove, put the new one on and go.\u201d"

    "content": "The U.S. Missile Defense Agency has awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth up to $4.1 billion to continue to field, maintain and upgrade its battle command system, according to an April 11 contract announcement from the Defense Department.\nThe contract period runs May 1, 2024, through April 30, 2029, with an option to extend it to April 30, 2034.\n\u201cThis contract will accelerate innovation and continue leading the development of the Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system,\u201d Lockheed said in a statement. \u201cUnder the new C2BMC-Next scope, the system will be upgraded with the latest 21st Century Security technology for faster, multi-domain coordinated responses to emerging threats.\u201d\nThe C2BMC system connects a wide variety of systems and radars that together form a global missile defense architecture that protects the homeland as well as U.S. and allied forces worldwide from long-range missile attacks.\nWork under the new C2BMC Next contract includes bringing in allies and partners, according to the company.\n\u201cPart of C2BMC-Next will be enhancing global integration, exploring possibilities of linking this decades-long proven, operationally-fielded system with allied nations for the first time,\u201d the American firm\u2019s statement noted.\n\u201cWith C2BMC\u2019s already well-established lines of reliable communication \u2014 operating 24/7, 365 days a year in more than 30 locations across the world \u2014 the ability to securely collaborate with other countries, across multiple domains, from any location in near real-time will be a game changer for the defense industry,\u201d according to Erika Marshall, Lockheed\u2019s vice president for C4ISR, which stands for command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.\nThe effort under the contract will also include providing C2BMC with technology \u201cthat will provide greater Space Domain Awareness,\u201d according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201cThrough the connection of sensors, and diffusion of data at a level that hasn\u2019t been done before, this enhancement will allow operators to see a complete view of the battlespace around the world.\u201d\nLockheed has been the prime contractor for C2BMC since 2002. The system, first fielded in 2004, has gone through numerous upgrades, which are spiraled in to adapt to threats. C2BMC was designed to focus from a strategic level down to an operational level.\nRecent upgrades since 2021 gave the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, system a single, composite, real-time picture of threats by tying into and fusing data from a broader set of sensors to include satellites as well as ground- and ship-based radars, according to the company.\nThe GMD system is a U.S.-based capability designed to defend the homeland against intercontinental ballistic missile threats, particularly from North Korea and Iran. The system is made up of interceptors buried in the ground at Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\nMDA also linked C2BMC to the Army\u2019s Integrated Battle Command System, which provides threat pictures down to the tactical level, as part of recent upgrades. IBCS, which reached full-rate production in 2023, is the command-and-control system for the Army\u2019s air and missile defense architecture.\nMore enhancements included giving C2BMC the capability to pass data back-and-forth with IBCS and other sensors, including space sensors.\nThe recent upgrades and upcoming development work done under the contract over the next several years will help the system support the Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative. JADC2 is the Pentagon\u2019s warfighting strategy focused on building an overarching network to fight advanced adversaries like China and Russia. This would require high-bandwidth, resilient communications as well as the ability to share massive amounts of data to help commanders rapidly make decisions.\nLockheed will perform the majority of its work under the new contract in Huntsville, Alabama, and Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nJen Judson is an award-winning journalist covering land warfare for Defense News.

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Missile Defense Agency began its next round of battle network upgrades with a bang, issuing three task orders worth a total of over $846.6 million to Lockheed Martin for services, software, and other aspects of what the company is calling C2BMC-Next.\nThe effort aims to improve MDA\u2019s long-standing Command, Control, Battle Management, & Communications (C2BMC) network, which first went operational in 2004, by adding new satellite feeds and other sensors, streamlined interservice data-sharing and even AI algorithms.\nThe long-expected IDIQ contract, first announced last year and awarded Thursday, could be worth up to $4.1 billion over 10 years if MDA exercises all available options.\nLockheed\u2019s been a lock for the sole-source contract since the start. \u201cNo other source has access to the required technical data and resident expertise to perform the described effort,\u201d MDA said last year. The aerospace titan is the long-established incumbent on C2BMC.\nC2BMC\u2019s very longevity and complexity makes it a model for the Pentagon\u2019s nascent CJADC2 initiative, a Combined Joint All-Domain Command & Control system intended to link, not just missile defenses, but all \u201csensors and shooters\u201d from satellites to stealth fighters to submarines. That\u2019s because the Pentagon decided years ago that replacing all its existing networks with one ring to rule them all was a technological and bureaucratic impossibility.\nRELATED: First version of all-service battle network is \u2018real and ready now\u2019: Hicks\nInstead the military would build up C2JADC2 as a kind of feudal confederation, an inter-service overlay to connect pre-existing and previously incompatible service-specific systems. The biggest such confederation already in service is C2BMC \u2014 whose version now under contract may well evolve into the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s contribution to CJADC2, alongside the Army\u2019s Project Convergence, the Navy\u2019s Project Overmatch, and the Air Force\u2019s ABMS.\n\u201cThe Ballistic Missile Defense System, as a major defense acquisition program, is not actually \u2018a\u2019 system \u2014 it is a collection of systems, each with their own fire control loops,\u201d explained Tom Karako, director of missile defense studies at the thinktank CSIS. \u201cIt\u2019s not replacing every fire control system everywhere \u2014 it\u2019s creating commonality, common data formats, so everyone can talk to each other better.\u201d\nThe C2BMC battle network sits atop three major missile defense systems built by multiple contractors for three different parts of the military: the Army\u2019s THAAD and accompanying AN/TPY-2 radar, the Ashore version of the Navy\u2019s Aegis shipboard air & missile defense, and MDA\u2019s own GMD (Ground-based Midcourse Defense).\nRELATED: Next Generation Interceptor selection coming this month, MDA chief says\nEach of these systems has its own missiles, command system, and links to radar, so it\u2019s capable of functioning independently. But C2MBC allows them to share data with each other, with satellites and earth-based radars, and with commanders at 33 sites around the world. That, in turn, enables coordinated planning and defense against missile threats capable of crossing the globe in minutes, which no single sensor can track from launch to impact.\nUnder its C2BMC-Next initiative, Lockheed Martin aims to upgrade that network in multiple ways. That includes improved tracking of cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles, which both fly slower but more unpredictable courses than ballistic missiles. It also aims to add artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms \u201cto detect, track, target, engage and assess emerging threats\u201d and even calculate defensive responses with \u201cmaximum coverage\u201d to protect as many lives as possible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a continuation of the current program that incorporates new elements that are being added in, such as NGI [Next Generation Interceptor], LRDR [Long Range Discrimination Radar], the forthcoming space sensor constellations, and so on.\u201d Karako said. \u201cEvery time they add some new component, some new element, you\u2019ve also got to work on the C2BMC piece so it can talk with everything else and support the larger system of systems.\u201d"

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lockheed Martin\u2019s secretive Skunk Works advanced development arm has unveiled a new project \u2014 a stealthy autonomous drone it calls Vectis that Lockheed intends to fly by the end of 2027.\nThe first Vectis prototype is currently \u201cin progress,\u201d but is envisioned as a large \u201cCategory 5\u201d reusable drone designed to be customizable to match shifts in the threat environment, said OJ Sanchez, Skunk Works\u2019s vice president and general manager.\n\u201cVectis provides best-in-class survivability at the CCA [Collaborative Combat Aircraft] price point,\u201d Sanchez told reporters ahead of the Air Force Association\u2019s Air Space and Cyber conference. \u201cPrototype parts are ordered, the team is in work, and we intend to fly in the next two years.\u201d\nLockheed sees the range, endurance and flexibility of Vectis\u2019s design as key to its appeal. Despite Sanchez\u2019s reference to CCA, the aircraft wasn\u2019t designed for the second iteration of that competition or any competition in particular. Rather, he said, it was developed by Skunk Works for the US and international markets based on feedback it had heard from multiple customers about the future battlefield.\nRELATED: Air Force picks Anduril, General Atomics for next round of CCA work\nVectis can carry out mission sets ranging from air-to-air, air-to-ground and ISR, and has an open systems architecture allowing it to interface with platforms and mission systems not built by Lockheed Martin, he said.\nCertain aspects of the drone \u2014 such as which payloads it can carry, or whether it is optimized for regular operations or used less frequently on deployments \u2014 can be fine-tuned even further to meet a customer\u2019s specific requirements.\nFor instance, \u201cwe will have built into it the ability for it to be a daily flyer, reliably work alongside its crew teammates, to be able to integrate into operations for training, as well as for deployment,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAt the same time, if the requirement is ease of storage and ease of assembly, it\u2019s absolutely built into the design. \u2026 That\u2019s where we\u2019ll work closely to listen with any individual customers and go from there on their operations choice, but the flexibility is built in.\u201d\nAs with most Skunk Works projects, Sanchez declined to comment on certain aspects of the aircraft\u2019s design, such as its engine or top speed, though he noted that Lockheed\u2019s analysis \u201cdoesn\u2019t point toward supersonic [speeds]\u201d as a requirement for drones.\nEXCLUSIVE: Navy taps four aerospace primes to design autonomous drone wingmen\nIn its current iteration, Vectis would be dependent on a runway to take off and land. However, it is designed to be maintainable in a deployed environment, with a simple design made of \u201cand durable, reliable materials\u201d and easy access to the aircraft\u2019s internal systems if repairs need to be made, Sanchez said.\nWhile Vectis has not flown, Lockheed has conducted operational analysis and simulations that paired the drone with the F-22 and F-35, with Sanchez noting that its low-observable signature and communications gear are \u201ccompatible\u201d with fifth- and sixth-generation aircraft.\nIt was also informed by previous experience designing tailless aircraft like the X-44 MANTA, Lockheed\u2019s work building a sixth-generation fighter prototype for the Air Force\u2019s Next Generational Air Dominance program, and prior demonstrations involving open missions systems and autonomy, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building in that kind of autonomy, that flexible autonomy, if you will, so that we can work with more countries, more partners, to really listen to what their needs are,\u201d he said. \u201cThat flexibility has been demonstrated through multiple demonstrations. Now we\u2019ll go out and build it, and we\u2019ll work to prove in the open air.\u201d\nWhile Sanchez stopped short of saying Vectis would certainly be Lockheed\u2019s offering for CCA increment 2, it could be a fit depending on the Air Force\u2019s final requirements for the program.\n\u201cShould the US Air Force find that they need a highly survivable platform with the flexibility that Vectis enables for increment 2, I think it will be a great candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe respect their process as they go through and see what\u2019s needed.\u201d"

    "content": "ORLANDO \u2014 A new AI platform that provides defense-grade security across environments is now available from Lockheed Martin, which has created a subsidiary to manage it.\nThe subsidiary, Astris AI, provides the company\u2019s AI Factory, offering an all-in-one operating model for all users. Companies or agencies that use it get access to the full arsenal of AI components available at the nation\u2019s largest defense contractor, according to Greg Forrest, Lockheed Martin Vice President of AI Foundations and Commercialization.\nThe platform, which can process massive amounts of data securely, fills a void for security across defense, aerospace, finance, healthcare, energy, and manufacturing industries. Forrest described the platform in a HUB session at AIAA SciTech Forum 2026 in January.\nWhile Lockheed has used its AI networks internally for years, Astris AI makes the same tools available to a wide range of users. Forrest explained, \u201cThere are many disparate tactical networks across the government. One of the big advantages of the AI factory is that we have the programs and the access to those networks to be able to go in and give them a really high level of AI and machine learning. We can go deep into those tactical networks to provide capability at the edge.\u201d\nAstris AI combines all Lockheed\u2019s AI agents and machine learning operations under one tent. It has available a suite of AI solutions, and customers can pick and choose modules that fit their needs, Forrest said.\nTogether, these pieces form a self-contained ecosystem that can ingest raw data, curate and label it, train models, validate them against tests, and monitor drift once the models are deployed.\nForrest illustrated the AI Factory\u2019s impact for the AIAA audience with case studies.\n- Orion Space Capsule \u2013 As the crewed vehicle for NASA\u2019s Artemis II mission prepares for launch, Lockheed is using AI to accelerate processes: natural language processing parses design documents and operation manuals, surfacing actionable items that shave weeks off the build schedule. Further, an AI-generated suite of tests scans newly written code for defects, catching bugs before the capsule ever leaves the ground.\n- Joint Simulation Environment \u2013 The U.S. Air Force and Navy jointly operate a high-fidelity virtual battlefield where new fighter jet capabilities are vetted. Rather than wade through dense manuals, operators now converse with a knowledge agent that understands the simulation\u2019s physics and can instantly spin up test scenarios.\n- Radar False Alarm Reduction \u2013 In the Red Sea, the U.S. Navy and Lockheed Martin used AI to develop and field updates for destroyers shooting down missiles and drones via a process called Aegis Speed To Capability. Lockheed software helped operators filter false alarms, reducing operator workload on naval ships.\n- Edge retraining for vision models on a small unmanned aerial system \u2013 When a forward deployed customer needed to identify objects hidden behind terrain, engineers used the AI Factory to \u201csee\u201d beyond line of sight and relay actionable intel to ground operators.\nThe success of these pilots revealed a market gap, Forrest noted, and Astris AI was born. By exporting the same modular stack that powers, say, new Aegis radar algorithms, the company sells a compliant, classified\u2011ready solution without reinventing the wheel for each client. Its benefit is threefold: It\u2019s modular, scalable, and secure.\nIn December, the company launched Astris AI for Government\u2122 to aid in operationalizing America\u2019s AI Action Plan through an integrated, turnkey AI platform that enables government agencies to build, deploy, and sustain trusted AI solutions. Teaming with Oracle, NVIDIA, and Meta, these solutions are now available through commercial federal procurement vehicles.\nX-Bow became the first to deploy Lockheed Martin\u2019s secure AI for rocket production, and this week, Albany Engineered Composites announced a deal with Astris AI to accelerate AI adoption across its advanced aerospace manufacturing operations.\nThe Astris AI Factory platform can be deployed on the HPE ProLiant Compute DL380a, an AI fine-tuning and inferencing platform, or on the HPE Edgeline EL8000, an edge server optimized for high-speed data analytics and AI/ML capable computing.\nForrest emphasized that technology alone does not deliver value. \u201cThe best tool in the world is useless if engineers don\u2019t know how to wield it,\u201d he said, outlining an internal consulting team that conducts workshops within program offices. This ecosystem ensures that AI tools are not just deployed but adopted \u2013 which can translate to increased productivity.\nForrest showed the audience that a digital thread could be expanded to span requirements, design, test, and sustainment \u2013 through a modular, open source, and customer-friendly AI Factory."

    "content": "Accelerating Integration: How Open Architecture, AI and Interoperability Are Redefining Coalition Air Power\nAt the 2025 Paris Air Show, Lockheed Martin hosted a strategic discussion that focused on one of the most urgent and complex defense imperatives facing allied nations today: how to achieve true warfighting integration across domains, platforms and partner nations\u2014at operational speed, and at scale.\nThe conversation, moderated by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics VP of Communications Melissa Due\u00f1as, featured:\n\u2022 Greg Ulmer, President, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics\n\u2022 OJ Sanchez, Vice President & General Manager, Skunk Works\u00ae, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics\n\u2022 General Mike Scaparrotti (Ret.), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\nWhat emerged was a clear articulation of where integrated deterrence must go next\u2014and how Lockheed Martin intends to lead.\nIn a near-peer threat environment where adversaries are rapidly closing capability gaps, simply fielding exquisite individual platforms is no longer sufficient. Instead, warfighting advantage will be defined by the ability to connect, fuse and act on data across disparate platforms, services and allied forces.\n\u201cFor some time now, we\u2019ve been focused on integrating horizontally across the entire enterprise\u2014air, land, sea, space and cyber spectrum,\u201d said Greg Ulmer, president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Today, we\u2019re breaking those down, integrating horizontally across the entire enterprise\u2014air, land, sea, space and cyber spectrum,\u201d Ulmer explained.\nThis horizontal integration is no longer theoretical. Ulmer pointed to Lockheed Martin\u2019s Ramstein Flag demonstration, where a Dutch F-35 detected a ground threat, passed highly classified targeting data via Skunk Works\u2019 open architecture gateway into Dutch command-and-control networks, enabling rapid engagement by ground artillery. All executed securely, outside the U.S. classified network boundary, in near real-time.\nWhile Skunk Works remains synonymous with cutting-edge solutions, Sanchez made clear that its real leadership today lies in enabling the connective tissue of multi-domain operations.\n\u201cThe true transformation isn\u2019t in individual components\u2014it\u2019s in how you link them as combat nodes in an open, adaptive network that can flex to mission needs,\u201d Sanchez said.\nFor more than a decade, Skunk Works has developed integration roadmaps that underpin this approach. Core pillars include:\n\u2022 Trusted autonomy & AI for real-time combat decision-making\n\u2022 Open System Architecture to eliminate proprietary barriers\n\u2022 Agile drone frameworks to enable manned-unmanned teaming at scale\n\u2022 Model-based digital threads that span design, build and sustainment\n\u2022 Rapid additive manufacturing that compresses sustainment timelines from weeks to hours\nSanchez emphasized that open standards\u2014not closed, vendor-specific architectures\u2014are the only viable path forward for the scale of international teaming required. \u201cOpen systems are not a luxury\u2014they are a necessity if allied nations expect to field integrated deterrence at speed.\u201d\nGeneral Scaparrotti brought the operational urgency into sharp focus: \u201cThroughout most of my career, innovation was government-driven. That has fundamentally changed. Today, U.S. industry is leading defense innovation, and the military must be far more aggressive in bringing forward its hardest problem sets to industry.\u201d\nHe emphasized that integrated allied combat power is the decisive advantage over peer adversaries. But achieving it demands that industry and government fully commit to new models of collaboration, data-sharing and innovation hubs that bring together operational commanders, technologists and industry problem-solvers in real-time.\n\u201cWe have the technology to integrate far beyond what we\u2019re fielding today,\u201d Scaparrotti said. \u201cThe challenge is no longer technical\u2014it\u2019s the cultural willingness to prioritize sharing, interoperability and speed.\u201d\nBeyond operations, the panel stressed that digital engineering is poised to fundamentally disrupt defense sustainment\u2014a key pressure point in any extended high-end conflict.\nSanchez described how full-scale determinant assembly\u2014using model-based design files, automated manufacturing and precision drilling\u2014has cut some complex assembly timelines from 30 days to 8 hours, while simultaneously eliminating rework.\nThe conversation closed with a clear call to action: The future of allied air power rests not on incremental upgrades but on operationalizing open, scalable integration across nations, platforms and domains\u2014at speed.\nLockheed Martin\u2019s leadership in open architecture, digital engineering, manned-unmanned teaming and AI-enabled combat systems will help enable that future to be reality.\nAs Ulmer summarized: \u201cOne plus one can no longer equal two. Integrated properly, one plus one must equal five. That\u2019s the multiplier effect allied air power must deliver if we\u2019re to maintain credible deterrence.\u201d"

    "content": "Lockheed Martin Pushes Suppliers Toward Urgent Cybersecurity Compliance\nLockheed Martin demands urgent CMMC Level 2 compliance from suppliers, emphasizing cybersecurity as a key factor for continued business relationships and securing the defense supply chain.\nAs of June 30, 2025, Lockheed Martin has formally raised the bar for its suppliers, with a new announcement that signals CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) compliance is no longer a future requirement. The aerospace and defense giant is making it clear that if you're a supplier handling Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), your cybersecurity practices will soon determine your place in their supply chain.\n\u201cLockheed Martin Supply Chain Cybersecurity is reaching out to all suppliers whose latest self-assessment is indicative of unmet cyber requirements (including unimplemented CMMC controls).\u201d\nThe Message is Clear: Be CMMC Level 2 Ready\nLockheed Martin\u2019s newly released supplier cybersecurity update highlights one critical expectation.\n\u201cBy now, all DIB companies managing CUI should have fully implemented \u2013 and be confidently meeting \u2013 NIST SP 800-171 (r2) requirements.\u201d\nThis announcement underscores that CMMC is no longer a future regulation, but it\u2019s a soon to be active gatekeeper to doing business with Lockheed Martin and, by extension, the Department of Defense (DoD).\nCCRA (Cybersecurity Compliance and Risk Assessment)\nLockheed Martin\u2019s release discusses a vital piece of the compliance puzzle for their suppliers: the Cybersecurity Compliance and Risk Assessment (CCRA) form. This Excel-based self-assessment, created in collaboration with ND-ISAC and top defense contractors like RTX, Booz Allen, and others, is the standard for measuring cyber risk in the supply chain.\nWhy it matters:\n- The CCRA reflects your current NIST 800-171 implementation.\n- It's a benchmark Lockheed is actively using to evaluate your cyber maturity.\n- Suppliers with outdated or incomplete assessments can expect direct outreach from Lockheed\u2019s cybersecurity supply chain team.\nIf you haven\u2019t been contacted, it might mean you're not currently viewed as critical, but it\u2019s also a golden opportunity to stand out.\nStrategic Insight: Use CMMC to Your Advantage\nFor proactive suppliers, this moment presents a competitive edge. Companies who can prove full CMMC Level 2 compliance or have a certification date in sight are uniquely positioned to leapfrog others in the supply chain.\nYou will quickly become a critical supplier if you're able to meet the CMMC requirements.\nDon\u2019t wait for the call. Lockheed Martin\u2019s new supplier portal (Exostar\u2019s soon-to-be-renamed \"Supplier Management\" module) is your hub for updating your CCRA and demonstrating your cyber readiness.\nWhy This Update Matters for the Defense Ecosystem\nCMMC is about securing the future of the U.S. defense infrastructure. Nation-state cyber threats are growing more sophisticated, and the DIB remains a prime target.\nBy enforcing CMMC standards across the supply chain, Lockheed Martin is helping to ensure that controlled unclassified information (CUI) stays protected, defense capabilities aren\u2019t compromised and only committed, secure vendors remain in the loop.\nNext Steps for Defense Suppliers\nIf you're a current or aspiring supplier to Lockheed Martin or other prime contractors, here\u2019s what you should be doing right now:\n- Ensure full implementation of NIST 800-171 Rev. 2 controls.\n- Map your current posture to CMMC Level 2 and certify ASAP.\n- Complete and update your CCRA.\n- Update your status via Exostar/Supplier Management portal.\n- Be proactive by informing your clients of your compliance status even if they haven\u2019t asked yet.\nFinal Thought: Compliance is the Cost of Entry\nLockheed Martin\u2019s announcement is a line in the sand. Suppliers that ignore it may find themselves edged out of defense contracts.\nThose that take action now, though, can become indispensable.\nCMMC can be a big advantage and opportunity for those who prepare now.\nIf you need help preparing for CMMC certification, Summit 7 is the leading provider of CMMC, NIST 800-171, and DFARS compliance solutions for the Defense Industrial Base.\nWhether you're starting from scratch or refining your current posture, our experts can help you build a compliant, resilient cybersecurity program."

    "content": "Pioneering Innovation:\nHow Lockheed Martin is using AI to transform cybersecurity\nIn the unseen battlespaces of the digital age, where cyber threats hide around every corner, the U.S. military and its allies are in an unrelenting battle to safeguard their most critical assets: the networks, systems, and secrets that power national defense.\nAs the cyber landscape rapidly evolves, industry leaders like Lockheed Martin are driving an unprecedented shift in operations by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to jump ahead of emerging cyber threats.\nAdvancing Cybersecurity\nWhen looking at the future of defense, cyber capabilities are at the frontlines. It is where conflict starts and deterrence is tested. With modern military operations relying heavily on software and data, cyber-attacks can have devastating effects. With networks down, you cannot operate, communicate, or make informed decisions. Because of this, increasing the cyber security and resiliency is a critical aspect of Lockheed Martin's operations. The Lockheed Martin Artificial Intelligence Center (LAIC) is at the heart of this innovation, driving the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI and ML solutions to enhance cyber defenses for the warfighter.\n\u201cThe current pace of change in AI research and the ever-increasing level of investments means that the state of the art (SOTA) AI five years ago is commonplace now,\u201d explained Dan Reese, Lockheed Martin Associate Fellow. \u201cLockheed Martin continues to mature and invest in cyber advancements and new capabilities using AI/ML that will allow our customers to maintain an edge on the battlefield.\"\nHere are three ways it\u2019s being done:\nThe LAIC is developing AI-powered threat detection systems that can identify and respond to emerging threats in real-time, reducing the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches before they occur.\nThese systems use advanced analytics and ML algorithms to analyze network traffic and system data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a potential threat. This in turn enables swift and effective response, reducing the risk of cyber-attacks, protecting critical systems and infrastructure.\nTo further enhance cybersecurity, Lockheed Martin is leading the way in cloud transformation, recognizing the immense benefits it offers in terms of scalability, flexibility, and cost savings. By migrating its systems and applications to the cloud, the company is able to enhance cybersecurity, reduce latency, and improve data processing speeds. The LAIC is playing a critical role in this effort, leveraging its expertise in AI and ML to develop cloud-based solutions that enable real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, and advanced threat detection.\nOne notable example of Lockheed Martin's cloud transformation is its work on the Department of Defense's (DoD) Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) program. The LAIC is collaborating with the DoD to develop a cloud-based architecture that enables seamless communication and data sharing across different domains, including air, land, sea, space, and cyber. This innovative approach will enhance situational awareness, improve decision-making, and increase the speed of response to emerging threats.\nWarfighting Solutions\nBy embracing cloud computing and AI/ML technologies, Lockheed Martin is enhancing cybersecurity, improving efficiency, and unlocking new insights and capabilities. These new cutting-edge technologies are also increasing the effectiveness of military operations, and drive the development of a more agile, adaptive, and responsive military force, capable of addressing the complex and evolving threats of the modern battlefield.\n\u201cWhat's exciting about AI is its ability to transform not only how we do work within Lockheed, but ultimately how we transform and provide new capabilities to the warfighter,\u201d stated Greg Forrest, AI Foundations Director. \u201cAt the end of the day, that's why we're here. We're here to support our customers. We're here to support our service members. And I think there's tremendous opportunity to utilize AI across the board to enable a more safe, secure world for our warfighters.\u201d"

    "content": "Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, in collaboration with Spanish technology company Arquimea, has demonstrated a machine learning-based anomaly detection system designed to enhance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations.\nThe capability allows ISR platforms to detect irregularities or changes in physical features using electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) data. This reduces the number of scans required by onboard sensors while enabling faster detection of hidden threats, wildfires, pollution, equipment failures, and other anomalies.\nThe demonstration simulated a small uncrewed air system (UAS) flying through a dense jungle environment. The UAS used neural networks trained with episodic memory to identify unexpected changes in the environment. Even when observing the scene from new angles, the system could compare stored data with current views to detect deviations using artificial intelligence.\nAccording to the companies, this approach moves beyond traditional image comparison. It equips AI systems with the ability to respond to unfamiliar situations, supporting more autonomous and reliable decision-making in complex environments.\nOJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager of Skunk Works, said the effort is part of a larger strategy to support crewed-uncrewed teaming.\nLockheed Martin and Arquimea plan to expand this research in 2025, focusing on how these anomaly detection techniques can enhance other sensor types and further improve autonomous system decisions.\nThe capability has potential applications in national security, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and industrial safety, according to the companies."

    "content": "In a world where the seas have become a new frontier for technological advancements, Lockheed Martin has unveiled a game-changing undersea drone that could forever alter the way we think about naval warfare. Meet \u201cLamprey,\u201d a covert, autonomous robot capable of clinging to the hulls of ships and submarines, recharging on the move, and then slipping away to gather intelligence or unleash a deadly strike.\nThis innovative design offers a glimpse into a future where small, persistent robots reshape the very foundations of how fleets maneuver, conceal themselves, and engage in combat beneath the waves. Lamprey\u2019s remarkable capabilities are poised to redefine the maritime domain, blurring the lines between stealth, surveillance, and strategic advantage.\nA Robot That Rides Shotgun Beneath the Waves\nImagine a world where your vessel, whether a warship or a commercial cargo ship, is never truly alone in the depths of the ocean. Lamprey, Lockheed Martin\u2019s latest undersea marvel, can silently attach itself to the hull of any ship or submarine, effectively becoming a stealthy companion on its journey.\nThis remarkable drone is equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing it to monitor its host\u2019s movements, collect valuable intelligence, and even serve as a relay for networked operations. The implications of such a capability are profound, as it opens up new avenues for covert surveillance, strategic positioning, and coordinated responses beneath the waves.\nLamprey\u2019s ability to latch onto and detach from its host at will also grants it a unique level of mobility and flexibility. Its autonomous nature means it can operate independently, scouting ahead, flanking, or even breaking off to pursue other objectives as needed.\nCovert Travel: Clinging to Ships and Submarines\nOne of Lamprey\u2019s most impressive features is its ability to seamlessly integrate with its host vessel, blending into the hull and becoming virtually indistinguishable from the ship or submarine it attaches to. This covert approach allows the drone to travel undetected, gathering intelligence or positioning itself for potential strikes without drawing any unwanted attention.\nImagine a scenario where a naval fleet is transiting through a contested waterway, unaware that a Lamprey drone has attached itself to one of the vessels. As the fleet progresses, the drone can collect real-time data on the formation, movement patterns, and potential vulnerabilities, relaying this information back to a command center ashore or to other assets in the vicinity.\nThis level of persistent, unobtrusive surveillance could prove invaluable in a range of strategic and tactical scenarios, from maintaining situational awareness in sensitive regions to preparing the battlefield for future operations.\nPayload Bay: From Spying to Striking\nBut Lamprey\u2019s capabilities go beyond mere intelligence gathering. Underneath its sleek, hydrodynamic exterior lies a payload bay that can be configured for a variety of mission-specific tasks, from electronic warfare and jamming to the delivery of miniaturized weapons or other payloads.\nImagine a Lamprey drone detaching from a vessel in the midst of a conflict, covertly navigating to a strategic position, and then unleashing a precise, targeted strike against an enemy submarine or surface ship. This level of agility and lethality could fundamentally alter the dynamics of underwater engagements, introducing a new dimension of asymmetric warfare.\nThe implications of such a versatile platform are vast, as Lamprey could be employed for everything from reconnaissance and surveillance to countermine operations and even direct action missions. Its ability to strike from unexpected angles and then quickly disengage could prove invaluable in a range of maritime scenarios.\nNetworking Undersea, Surface and Air Forces\nLamprey\u2019s true power lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate with a broader network of sensors, platforms, and forces, both above and below the water\u2019s surface. By acting as a mobile node in a distributed, underwater communications grid, Lamprey can relay critical information and coordinate the actions of ships, submarines, and even aerial assets.\nThis level of connectivity and interoperability could revolutionize the way naval forces plan and execute operations, allowing them to achieve greater situational awareness, faster decision-making, and more effective responses to emerging threats.\nImagine a scenario where a fleet is facing a swarm of enemy surface vessels or underwater drones. A Lamprey attached to one of the friendly ships could detect the incoming threat, rapidly communicate the information to other assets, and even guide coordinated countermeasures or counterattacks \u2013 all while maintaining its own covert presence.\nSea Denial on a Budget\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Lamprey is its potential cost-effectiveness, particularly when compared to traditional, platform-centric approaches to maritime security and power projection. By leveraging a relatively low-cost, autonomous drone, navies and maritime agencies could potentially extend their reach and capabilities without the need for expensive new ship or submarine acquisitions.\nThis \u201csea denial on a budget\u201d approach could prove particularly attractive to smaller nations or those with limited defense budgets, allowing them to counter the military advantages of larger, more resource-rich adversaries. Lamprey\u2019s versatility and modularity also mean that it can be adapted to a wide range of missions and operational environments, further enhancing its value proposition.\nAs the global strategic landscape continues to evolve, the ability to project power and maintain control of the seas will become increasingly crucial. Lamprey\u2019s innovative design and disruptive potential offer a glimpse into a future where the balance of naval power may be redefined by the seamless integration of small, autonomous systems.\nA Hint of Limpet Mine Tactics\nLamprey\u2019s ability to cling to the hulls of ships and submarines is reminiscent of the historical use of limpet mines, a tactic employed by various naval forces throughout the 20th century. These explosive devices were designed to adhere to the outer surface of a vessel, detonating on contact or on a delayed timer to inflict significant damage.\nWhile Lamprey is not intended to be a direct replacement for limpet mines, its hull-clinging capabilities do evoke a similar level of stealth and precision. However, the drone\u2019s versatility extends far beyond simple explosive payloads, offering a range of non-kinetic and strategic applications that could reshape the maritime domain.\nThe parallels to limpet mine tactics, combined with Lamprey\u2019s autonomous and networked nature, suggest a future where small, persistent robots play an increasingly prominent role in naval warfare, challenging traditional assumptions about the nature of maritime power projection and sea control.\nWhere Lamprey Sits in the Wider Arms Race\nLockheed Martin\u2019s unveiling of the Lamprey drone comes at a time of heightened strategic competition and technological innovation in the maritime domain. As nations around the world seek to bolster their naval capabilities, the development of small, stealthy, and highly capable autonomous systems has become a key area of focus.\nLamprey\u2019s unique blend of stealth, mobility, and multi-mission versatility positions it as a significant development in this ongoing arms race. By offering a cost-effective solution that can be integrated into existing naval operations, the drone could provide a strategic advantage to those who field it, potentially disrupting the traditional balance of power on the high seas.\nAs the global community grapples with the implications of this emerging technology, it will be crucial to engage in thoughtful discussions around the ethical, legal, and security considerations surrounding the use of autonomous systems in the maritime environment. The responsible development and deployment of platforms like Lamprey will be paramount in ensuring the safety and stability of the world\u2019s oceans.\nWhat \u201cAutonomy\u201d Means at Sea\nThe concept of \u201cautonomy\u201d in the context of maritime operations is a complex and multifaceted issue. For a system like Lamprey, autonomy encompasses a range of capabilities, from the ability to navigate and maneuver independently to the capacity to make real-time decisions and adapt to changing conditions.\nHowever, the degree of autonomy and the level of human oversight required for the safe and ethical deployment of such systems remains an area of ongoing debate and research. Factors such as target identification, rules of engagement, and the mitigation of unintended consequences must be carefully considered as these autonomous platforms become more prevalent in the maritime domain.\nAs the technology behind systems like Lamprey continues to evolve, the definition of \u201cautonomy\u201d will likely become more nuanced, with a greater emphasis on human-machine collaboration, transparent decision-making, and robust safeguards to ensure the responsible use of these capabilities.\nRisks, Countermeasures and What Comes Next\nWhile the potential benefits of Lamprey and similar autonomous underwater drones are significant, it is essential to recognize the potential risks and challenges associated with their development and deployment. Issues such as cyber vulnerabilities, detection and countermeasures, and the potential for unintended consequences will all need to be carefully addressed.\nAs nations and organizations explore the use of these systems, it will be crucial to invest in the research and development of effective countermeasures, including enhanced underwater detection and tracking capabilities, as well as the development of robust cybersecurity protocols to protect these platforms from hacking or unauthorized access.\nThe future of maritime operations will undoubtedly be shaped by the continued evolution of autonomous systems like Lamprey. As this technology matures, we can expect to see an increasingly complex and dynamic interplay between naval forces, strategic considerations, and the integration of these small, persistent robots into the fabric of global maritime security.\n| Key Features of Lockheed Martin\u2019s Lamprey Drone | Specifications |\n|---|---|\n| Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) | Length: 6 feet (1.8 meters) |\n| Ability to Attach to Ship/Submarine Hulls | Diameter: 12 inches (30 cm) |\n| Recharging Capabilities While Attached | Weight: Approximately 200 lbs (90 kg) |\n| Payload Bay for Sensors, Payloads, or Weapons | Endurance: Up to 30 days |\n| Networked Operations and Communication | Depth Rating: Over 1,000 feet (300 meters) |\n| Potential Applications of the Lamprey Drone | Description |\n|---|---|\n| Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) | Gather real-time data on vessel movements, environmental conditions, and potential threats. |\n| Covert Delivery of Payloads | Deploy sensors, electronic warfare systems, or even miniaturized weapons on enemy targets. |\n| Underwater Communications Relay | Serve as a mobile node in a networked grid, enabling enhanced coordination between surface, subsurface, and aerial assets. |\n| Mine Countermeasures | Detect, track, and potentially neutralize underwater mines and other explosive threats. |\n| Escort and Protection of High-Value Assets | Provide persistent, covert surveillance and deterrence around critical naval and commercial vessels. |\n\u201cLamprey represents a significant leap forward in the realm of autonomous underwater systems. Its ability to seamlessly integrate with and support a wide range of naval operations is a game-changer.

    "content": "Canada may well cancel part of its 2022 order for 88 Lockheed Martin F-35As and replace them with Saab JAS 39E Gripens. One report suggests that Ottawa might cut the order in half and accept a Swedish offer for 72 lower-cost Saab Gripens.\nThe Gripen has matured and the F-35 is not as good a deal as it looked in 2021, but the driving factor is Washington\u2019s trade and foreign policy.\nSlashing the F-35 buy would be the first seismic fracture in a 70-year trade between the United States and those allies, including Australia and Japan, who did not maintain the ability to produce top-line combat aircraft and instead bought from the US. It foreshadows what I predicted soon after President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election: a changed industrial and defence order based on collaboration among the US\u2019s erstwhile buyers.\nLow-friction interoperability in US-centred coalition forces was a strategic argument for the F-35, and the justification for the US exporting stealth technology. Another selling point for the F-35 was the power of mass: high production rates and a large fleet, along with a global logistics system, were intended to keep the cost of a large, complex aircraft within national budgets.\nAt the start of the F-35 program in 2001, Canada bought into both arguments. Today, it\u2019s a raging debate that reflects internal and international politics, the performance of the program, and a Swedish industry seeking opportunities as US influence wavers.\nControversy dates back 15 years. Canada signed on to the production phase of the program in 2007, and the Conservative government of Stephen Harper (2006 to 2015) wanted to buy the F-35 without a competition.\nCanadian law forbids this unless the government can show that only one contractor can do the job. The Harper administration\u2019s ham-fisted efforts to do this were derailed by parliamentary budgeteers and the country\u2019s auditor-general. The delay tipped the decision to Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government of 2015 to 2025, which reopened the competition.\nDassault and Eurofighter decided not to play. Boeing\u2019s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet bid took a hit before the first bell: the company\u2019s complaints about subsidies for C-Series airliner of Canadian company Bombardier prompted the Trump administration to impose retaliatory tariffs, forcing that project\u2019s sale to Airbus. Canada finally chose the F-35 in March 2022 over the Gripen and Super Hornet.\nThat would have been the end of it, but Trump was re-elected, threatening tariff wars and calling for Canada to become the 51st state. This helped keep the Liberal party in power under new prime minister Mark Carney, with a promise to review the fighter program.\nIn relation to Canada, the Trump administration has been assiduously digging a deeper hole. The National Security Strategy released in December asserted US dominance over the Americas. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra warned on 26 January that the North American Air Defense (NORAD) agreement would be changed if Canada bought Gripens and that the US would have to send aircraft into Canadian airspace to cover the gap. Hoekstra, veteran Canadian defence journalist David Pugliese wrote, had \u2018given Carney all the cover he needed\u2019 to break from the F-35.\nRight-wing separatists in the resource-rich Alberta province claim to have met with \u2018senior\u2019 White House officials. At the end of January, the US president made a bizarre threat to \u2018decertify\u2019 Canadian aircraft on the US register or impose further massive tariffs.\nA seemingly damning excerpt from the 2021 evaluation was leaked to Canadian public radio in late November but had little effect except to underscore the change in the competitive balance.\nSaab\u2019s Gripen E and GlobalEye airborne warning and control aircraft, unproven in 2021, have entered service. Sweden has joined NATO, and Saab is talking to Bombardier, offering Canadia a manufacturing partnership and a system comprising Gripens and GlobalEye. A November visit to Canada by Sweden\u2019s king and queen was a choreographed sales event.\nWhen Canada made its 2022 decision, Lockheed Martin was promising a comprehensive Block 4 package of new sensors and computers for the F-35 by 2026 and improvements in availability and mission capable rates as the system matured. But since we reviewed the program here in August, reports from the Government Accountability Office in September, and from the Pentagon inspector general have been disappointing.\nF-35s delivered since 2023 have software usable only for training. A plan for a new Block 4 package, cut back to fit schedules, budgets and the F-35\u2019s thermal management capacity was due late last year, according to the accountability office, but has not yet been seen. RTX\u2019s new Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EO-DAS) for the F-35 has not finished tests. The inspector general\u2019s report showed availability and mission capable rates well below threshold values and reported widespread cannibalisation.\nOttawa knows about this, I can confirm. Sixteen F-35s that Canada has paid for are secure; the rest, not so much.\nOne group solidly supports Canada staying with the F-35: retired senior leaders of the Royal Canadian Air Force. CBC radio reported in November that a dozen former commanders had signed a letter to Carney opposing any Gripen order.\nCBC said one of the signatories of the letter was former defence staff chief Tom Lawson. He did not confirm signing the letter, but he commented, \u2018The F-35 is so far beyond anything that the Gripen can provide that anything you\u2019d be saving in terms of money by going to a second fleet would be lost, because that fleet would be close to useless in a wartime situation.\u2019 Others taking the same view include former RCAF deputy commander Major General Colin Kiever, quoted as saying that cancellation would be \u2018cutting our nose off to spite our face.\u2019\nFirst issue: culture eats strategy for breakfast, and change is fear. The RCAF has been joined at the hip to the US Air Force for more than 60 years. The two services\u2019 leaders have trained and fought alongside one another, and the RCAF has not bought a non-USAF fighter since the mid-1950s.\nSecond: many of these leaders were personally involved in the acquisition of the F-35, and that was not always an ideal process. For example: The mandatory requirements that buttressed Harper\u2019s sole-source procurement plan included an infra-red all-round vision system\u2014uniquely met by the F-35\u2019s EO-DAS, which hasn\u2019t worked that well\u2014but excluded transonic acceleration, an odd omission considering the NORAD role.\nThird: it\u2019s almost inevitable, given Canada\u2019s position as a market for US defence equipment, and as a trade partner with the US for agriculture, energy and automotives, that US-funded lobbying is a major industry, along with US-owned media.\nAcquisition, like war, may be too serious a matter to be left to the generals."

    "content": "According to reports, U.S. F-35 might have been delivered since June 2025 with a ballast in place of the new APG-85 radar which has been suffering from delays.\nRecent reports indicate that a number of newly delivered F-35 Lightning II aircraft may be entering service without a fully installed onboard radar. The issue, first reported last week by Defense Daily and affiliate publication Avionics International, reportedly affects F-35s delivered to the U.S. military since June 2025.\nThese aircraft were planned to receive the new APG-85 radar, developed to replace the current APG-81 radar on F-35s in Block 4 configuration starting with Production Lot 17. However, the new radar is being affected by delays and has reportedly yet to enter the production stage.\nThe development of the APG-85 was first publicly acknowledged by the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) in 2023, followed few days later by Northrop Grumman\u2019s announcement. The company also manufactures the current APG-81.\nOfficial Statements\nAs the original reports quoted an unnamed source, we reached out to the F-35 JPO, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Air Force. While the latter two did not return our request for a statement at the time of writing, Lockheed Martin referred us to the JPO.\nIn an emailed statement, an F-35 JPO spokesperson told us:\nF-35 Lightning II aircraft are being built to accommodate the F-35 advanced radar (APG-85) for U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Initial fielding for some F-35 aircraft is planned for Lot 17, which began delivery in 2025 and continues through September 2026.\nDue to program security reasons, we are protecting any additional information with enhanced security measures.\nAs a matter of fact, the statement neither confirms nor denies the reports about the radar-less F-35s. While no official confirmation has been issued to the public, Congress is already informed about the issue.\nRep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.). Vice Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee was recently asked about the reports, to which he replied \u201cI know all about it, but the delivery of the aircraft is classified,\u201d adding he \u201ccan\u2019t speak to the condition of the aircraft.\u201d\nHowever, he also commented about the integration of the new radar, which he defined as \u201cchallenging.\u201d\n\u201cThe APG-81 is different than the APG-85, and therefore delivering the aircraft, as currently configured, with an APG-85 radar versus an APG-81 radar is challenging,\u201d said Wittman. \u201cThe bulkhead configuration is key because for both of the radars, they are very different.\u201d\nThe congressman praised the capabilities of the APG-85, explaining that the radar is among the reasons for the upgrades to the engine. As we previously reported here at The Aviationist, Pratt & Whitney is working on the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU), designed to enhance thermal management and auxiliary power generation to meet the growing demands of the F-35\u2019s onboard systems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly advanced radar,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cThe arrays on it give it much more power which is why we have to upgrade the engine. I think we need about 82 kilowatts of power versus what it\u2019s producing right now. The APG-85 is key to Block 4, and it\u2019s key to TR-3 software upgrade capabilities and integration with the imaging system, the Distributed Aperture System.\u201d\nMeasures are being taken to accelerate delivery. Wittman said steps taken so far \u201ccondensed the testing regime,\u201d while work is being done to \u201ccontinue to compress the schedule\u201d even more.\n\u201cI spoke to Lockheed [\u2026], and they\u2019re working with Northrop to get APG-85 delivered even faster,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope they do it as fast as humanly possible and have the system perform. I don\u2019t want it delivered, if it\u2019s gonna be operationally deficient because then the aircraft sits on the tarmac.\u201d\nRadar-less F-35s\nAccording to the unnamed source, the issue only affected F-35s delivered to the U.S. military, as they are currently the only ones slated to receive the new radar. Even without the radar, the aircraft are still airworthy, although they required a ballast in the nose to avoid affecting the balance while in flight.\nIt must be noted that the issue, while its severity is not negligible, it is not unprecedented. In fact, in the 1980s, the Royal Air Force\u2019s Tornado F.2 was initially delivered without the Foxhunter radar due to delays, replaced by a concrete ballast for balance.\nAn obvious question would be why, given the delays with the APG-85, the F-35s were not delivered with the APG-81 as interim solution. This is not possible because of the different bulkhead configuration, which makes the two radars not interchangeable.\nOne of the reasons is related to the fact that the bulkhead is also used to correctly place the radar so the array can be in the correct attitude. Having to use a different attitude would greatly affect the performance of the radar.\nAccording to Breaking Defense, Lockheed Martin\u2019s CEO Jim Taiclet already warned in 2025 about possible risks in the radar\u2019s delivery schedule. A solution to mitigate these risks has also been proposed, although it would take possibly two years to deliver.\nIn fact, Taiclet wrote in an unclassified letter to then Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin that, as part of \u201cproactive steps to create viable options,\u201d the company already started designing a new bulkhead that \u201csupports a decision point to determine which radar system to include in U.S. Lot 20 production aircraft deliveries.\u201d\nThis would mean that, counting all U.S. aircraft in Lots 17, 18 and 19, up to 229 aircraft might be affected by the delays in the radar delivery. However, if only the F-35As were to be affected \u2013 as the initial report specifically mentioned the A variant when asking Wittman for comment \u2013 that number would decrease to 131 airframes.\nBallast\u2019s Photo\nImmediately after the first reports regarding the radar issue came out, a photo went viral, showing one of the presumed radar-less F-35s with the nose cone removed and the ballast installed. However, that image is completely unrelated and dated to even before the delays of the APG-85 became known.\nIn fact, the image was captured at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, on Sept. 17, 2024, during a joint training exercise on crash, damaged, disabled aircraft recovery (CDDAR) procedures. Moreover, the F-35A in the photo is partially disassembled, with more than just the nosecone missing, not to mention the emergency services Marines that can be seen in the foreground.\nAdding to the incongruencies, the ballast seen installed on that F-35A appears to be made of four gym weight plates, possibly the 45 lb (20.4 kg) plates that can be commonly found in U.S. gyms. While such a ballast would work on the ground and preserves the airframe\u2019s balance, it is unlikely to be used in flight operations, with possibly a more specific solution being used.\nTransition to APG-85 and Tech Refresh 3/Block 4\nIt is important to note that the APG-85 is one of the main components of the Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) and the associated Block 4 configuration. Issues with the new configuration prompted a halt to the deliveries in July 2023.\nA year later, in July 2024, the F-35 JPO and Lockheed Martin agreed on a \u201ctruncated\u201d version of the new configuration as stopgap, allowing to resume deliveries. Details about the truncated TR-3 were not released, but this allowed to finally clear the backlog in May 2025.\nA total of 72 jets piled up at Lockheed Martin\u2019s plant in Fort Worth, Texas, a decrease in the initial estimates that forecasted up to 120 F-35s that could be undelivered. The clearing of the backlog also contributed to the company setting a record delivering 191 F-35s in 2025.\nWith these aircraft being part of the earlier Lot 16, they would not be affected by the radar problem as they would come out of the production line with the APG-81. It is unclear if the decision to install a ballast instead of the APG-85, if confirmed, was part of measures being taken to avoid having F-35s piling up again until the deliver of the new radars.\nThe Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) has been defined as the \u201cbackbone\u201d for the upcoming Block 4 upgrade. The Block 4 includes hardware upgrades to 75 major systems, with enhancements to the electronic warfare suite, the new APG-85 radar, EOTS (Electro-Optical Tracking System), improved cockpit displays, navigation and communication systems and a next-generation Distributed Aperture System (DAS).\nThe program experienced severe issues which greatly impacted the fielding schedule of the new configuration. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the issues were mainly attributed to software that could not support the F-35\u2019s radar and electronic warfare systems as intended.\n\u201cProgram officials stated that early versions of radar and in-flight systems software can commonly experience rebooting issues,\u201d the GAO said. \u201cHowever, even after being nearly a year delayed, TR-3 software continues to be unstable, according to test officials.\u201d\nThe interim \u201ctruncated\u201d TR-3 offers some of the planned capabilities while the remainder of the problems is being solved. The complete TR-3 is planned to be later retrofitted on delivered aircraft, with the retrofit requiring 14 days of downtime and performed during scheduled maintenance, as we previously reported here at The Aviationist.\nAPG-85\nAs we mentioned in our previous reports, the mention of the APG-85 first appeared in the U.S. Air Force\u2019s unfunded wish list for Fiscal Year 2023, which included seven F-35A in Block 4 configuration with the APG-85 radar as part of the Lot 17. The APG-85 designation emerged again few months later, with the F-35 JPO later confirming that indeed a new radar was in the works.\n\u201cThe U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are jointly developing and integrating an advanced radar for the F-35 Lightning II, which is capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats,\u201d said the F-35 JPO. \u201cThis advanced radar will be compatible with all variants of the F-35 aircraft.\u201d\nWithout knowing anything else, the APG-85 might be a heavily modified APG-81, to such extent that it required a new designation, or a completely new radar being developed. In fact, if that was just an upgrade, the designation would have been APG-81v1, as done for other radars.\nThe development of the APG-81 officially started in 2001, although it traced its roots to the 1990s. Described as the successor of the F-22\u2019s APG-77, the radar is based on Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA), with air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mapping, Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities.\nThe new APG-85 is planned to incorporate some of the latest technologies available, with unconfirmed rumors mentioning the possibility of the adoption of Gallium Nitride (GaN) for the Transmit/Receive (T/R) modules. The radar is meant to defeat \u201ccurrent and projected adversarial air and surface threats\u201d over the next decades.\nNorthrop Grumman, which already manufactures the current APG-81 radar, also emerged as the developer of the APG-85. The JPO did not disclosed if this radar will be available to all F-35 users or if it will remain a U.S.-only system.\nImplications\nThe radar-less F-35s would be significantly constrained during operations. While the F-35\u2019s sensor fusion allows it to receive targeting data from other networked platforms, the absence of an onboard radar would limit independent air-to-air and air-to-ground mission capability.\nSuch aircraft would likely be restricted to training, ferry, or limited test roles until retrofitted with a functional sensor. This approach would mirror previous periods in the F-35 program when aircraft were delivered with incomplete mission systems pending later upgrades.\nAt present, without official details about the radar issue, many questions remain unanswered, including the number of aircraft delivered without the radar and the timelines for both the delivery of the new radar and the retrofit on those aircraft. Whether the current situation represent a short-term integration hiccup or a more extensive problem will likely become clearer as official data emerges from the Pentagon and industry.\nNevertheless, the introduction of the APG-85 remains a central element of the F-35\u2019s long-term relevance against evolving air defense and fighter threats. The new challenges however underscore the continuing complexity of fielding advanced capabilities within a program of the F-35\u2019s scale.\nAt the same time, the issues also underscore how critical is the supply chain and how issues with one of the links can affect the remainder of the chain. This is further reflected by the operational aspect, as such issues introduce temporary capability gaps that require retrofit programs and phased upgrades to be assessed."

    "content": "Summary\n- The F-35's Distributed Aperture System by Raytheon enhances pilots' situational awareness significantly.\n- Both Raytheon's EODAS and Lockheed Martin's EOTS have proven successful in combat with the Israeli Air Force.\n- Royal Australian Air Force and Israeli Air Force F-35s have performed well despite US-owned reliability issues.\nThe F-35 Lightning II is here to stay. As mentioned in previous articles on this fifth-generation fighter, despite all the controversies surrounding the technical foibles and expensive cost overruns that afflict US-owned F-35s, the aircraft continues to attract foreign military sales (FMS). The Israeli Air Force has used the warbird in combat with satisfactory results, and, as some Royal Australian Force (RAAF) officers recently told me: \"We love them!\"\nWe Asked The Australian Air Force How The F-35 Lightning II Is Performing\nU.S.-owned F-35s are notorious for their reliability issues. Yet the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F-35s are performing just fine, thanks.\nThe F-35 has many technological capabilities that give it an edge, one of which is the Distributed Aperture System. With this in mind, let's examine how the DAS significantly boosts its pilots' situational awareness.\nEODAS basics: the Raytheon perspective\nThe F-35 itself is a product of Lockheed Martin's \"Skunk Works\" program, the same entity (founded by the late great Clarence Leonard \"Kelly\" Johnson [February 27, 1910 \u2013 December 21, 1990]), which also produced the following legendary aircraft:\n- The F-22 Raptor\n- The SR-71 Blackbird\n- The U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" spy plane\n- The P-38 Lightning\nLearn more about Skunk Works.\nHowever, the DAS system, or more completely, the EODAS (Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System), is the brainchild of Raytheon, specifically Raytheon's Vision Systems division in Goleta, California. It shows how well rival firms in the defense industry are willing to cooperate when doing so is mutually beneficial. Here's what Raytheon's info page on EODAS has to say:\n\"Raytheon\u2019s Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) provides a 360-degree sensor suite for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. This advanced sensor capability gives F-35 pilots unprecedented situational awareness and survivability to operate and to navigate safely in any environment \u2013 from detecting missiles passively to circumnavigating severe weather conditions \u2013 in the Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) battlespace.\"\nAddressing \"Advanced sensor technology,\" the company adds this:\n\"The pilot\u2019s helmet-mounted display (HMD) brings in data from Raytheon's next-generation F-35 EODAS, which collects and sends real-time, high-resolution imagery to the HMD from six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft. The 5th Generation F-35\u2019s advanced sensors produce a wealth of new data \u2012 electronic warfare signals, electro-optical and infrared imagery, missile warning cues and more \u2012 all capable of creating new forms of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting information.\"\nIn terms of the \"360-degree awareness,\" enabled by EODAS the company adds:\n\"Rather than relying on frequent maneuvers to achieve full defensive threat coverage or employing a specific formation to focus on varying sectors, pilots can see the entire operating picture through one system, resulting in a significant upgrade from fixed sensors on older aircraft...The sensors use two key components from across RTX: the strained layer super lattice (SLS) detector material (from commercial foundries) is processed using the same revolutionary manufacturing techniques to develop the GaN semiconductors in Andover, Massachusetts...\"\n\"...The EODAS SLS detector material is then integrated into focal plane arrays by engineers at Raytheon Vision Systems in Goleta, California. These advancements, coupled with digital pixel technology and a digital read-out integrated circuit, give pilots a quick, high-definition picture of everything around them, culminating in a more capable missile detection system.\"\nA more simplified explanation of the rewards of EODAS (or just plain \"DAS\" as the US Department of Defense [DOD] is content to call it) is available from the DOD's Joint Strike Fighter [JSF] page:\n- Missile detection and tracking\n- Launch point detection\n- Situational awareness Infrared Search and Track System (IRST) & cueing\n- Weapons support\n- Day/night navigation\nImproved situational awareness is vital to combat aviators. A literal split-second can make the difference between life and death, allowing pilots to get inside the enemy's OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) Loop first instead of the other way around.\nLockheed Martin EOTS complements EODAS\nNot to be outdone, Lockheed Martin has developed its own \"in-house\" system, the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), which complements Raytheon's EODAS contribution.\nAccording to Lockheed Martin's official product info page:\n\"The Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) for the F-35 Lightning II is an affordable, high-performance, lightweight, multi-function system that provides precision air-to-air and air-to-surface targeting capability. The low-drag, stealthy EOTS is integrated into the F-35 Lightning II's fuselage with a durable sapphire window and is linked to the aircraft's integrated central computer through a high-speed fiber-optic interface.\"\nEODAS and EOTS are proven in combat\n\"The proof of the pudding is in the eating,\" as the saying goes. The Israeli Air Force has already used their Lightning IIs (which they have redubbed the \"Adir\"/\u05d0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e8, which translated to \"Mighty One\") in combat. The first time was in 2018. According to Simple Flying's Alexander Mitchell, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) kept schtum about specific details of that first \"blooding\" of the Adir, other than a brief statement by an IAF Major General to Defense News that:\n\"We are the first in the world to use the F-35 in operational activity.\"\n5th Gen Fighter Jet: How Israel Got Its Hands On The F-35 Lightning II\nThe Israeli Air Force operates the world's most capable multirole stealth fighter.\nFast-forward to 2021, and IAF pilots would score the F-35 platform's first aerial victories, shooting down multiple Iranian drones. And in late October or early November 2023, IAF Adir drivers shot down a cruise missile that had apparently been launched by Iran-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen.\nIn all cases, the planes and their systems worked optimally, with the targets successfully destroyed and pilots and planes returning to be (RTB) alive, in one piece, and undamaged. Although the IAF spokesperson made no specific mention of (EO)DAS or EOTS, it can still be reasonably inferred that these combat incidents serve as testimonials of the effectiveness of these systems.\nUSS Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Arrives In Middle East Equipped With F-35C & F/A-18 Block III Fighter Jets\nBoosting US air capabilities in the region."

    "content": "The Sniper NTP integrates a multi-datalink, multi-processor Hybrid Base Station (HBS) with the existing Sniper ATP, turning it into an airborne communications and edge-computing node.\nLockheed Martin has unveiled the latest evolution of its proven Sniper targeting pod, called the Sniper Networked Targeting Pod (NTP), whose development was announced last year. By integrating a multi-datalink, multi-processor Hybrid Base Station (HBS) with the existing Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP), the new system becomes an airborne communications and edge-computing node.\nSniper NTP\nThe image accompanying the press release shows the outer shape of the Sniper pod almost untouched, with the difference being a conformal section attached below the middle section of the pod. It is likely that this section hosts the arrays used by the datalink to share the data with other assets.\nNotably, the Sniper NTP allows the carrier aircraft to easily communicate with the F-35 Lightning II. In fact, the company says \u201cthe Hybrid Base Station (HBS) utilizes a flexible architecture to support various datalinks and processors, including the Multifunction Advanced Datalink (MADL) for F-35 interoperability and Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) radios for resilient mesh networking.\u201d\nThe pod is described as a cost-effective, flexible \u201cplug-and-play design\u201d that will let users add secure high-speed communications and processing to their aircraft. This way, fourth-generation aircraft can receive and act on sensor data from fifth-generation aircraft, as well as other networked sources.\n\u201cWithout compromising stealth, an F-35 can identify targets and pass precise coordinates through Sniper NTP to an F-16 which can then engage the target using long range weapons,\u201d says Lockheed Martin. \u201cThis secure data sharing at 5G+ speeds is a critical node to connect fighters, ground stations, uncrewed aircraft, Navy vessels and satellites.\u201d\nThe company further said that \u201cfuture demonstrations will showcase multi-aircraft coordination, secure video share and dynamic targeting handoffs.\u201d As a concept of operation, an infographic shows an F-35 sharing a threat\u2019s location trough MADL with two Sniper NTP-equipped F-16s, which then use MANET to further relay the information to a command center for an engagement with HIMARS.\n\u201c[Sniper NTP] provides a cost-effective, flexible upgrade path that extends mission relevance without aircraft modification \u2014 a capability many allied air forces have asked for as they look to keep long-serving fourth-generation aircraft ready and capable in an increasingly mixed-fleet and digital environment,\u201d says Lockheed Martin. The F-16 Block 70/72 would be a likely candidate to be equipped with the Sniper NTP, as these newly built aircraft (and the upgraded F-16Vs) will be flying together with modern assets like the F-35 for the years to come.\nSniper ATP\nThe AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) is one of the most widely fielded EO/IR targeting systems, with more than 1,650 pods delivered and more than five million operational hours logged in U.S. and allied air forces. The system provides long-range target detection, precision identification and laser designation for a broad range of strike and ISR missions.\nThe pod combines a high-definition mid-wave infrared sensor with a stabilized TV camera and a dual-mode laser designator/illuminator. This sensor suite allows aircrews to acquire, track and identify targets at significant stand-off ranges, while generating weapon-quality coordinates to support GPS-guided and laser-guided munitions.\nLockheed Martin highlights that the pod\u2019s advanced image-processing and automated tracking algorithms significantly reduce pilot workload, enabling stable tracking of moving targets even during high-speed maneuvers. In addition to its strike role, the Sniper ATP has become a valuable non-traditional ISR asset during its many combat deployments.\nThe pod can also record and downlink full-motion video with metadata to ground controllers or other aircraft, supporting real-time coordination in dynamic environments. This way, the Sniper ATP can also provide overhead surveillance for ground units, adding another layer of security.\nAs we previously reported here at The Aviationist, the pod\u2019s high-resolution IR imagery has proven useful even in air-to-air contexts, being adopted to aid in the identification of tracks of interest by Quick Reaction Alert aircraft. A notable case was Taiwanese F-16Vs using their Sniper pods to capture detailed IR footage of PLA Navy J-15 fighters during a close encounter."

It says this secure sharing of data at 5G plus speeds forms a critical node that links fighters, ground stations, uncrewed aircraft, naval vessels and satellites.\nLockheed Martin notes that Sniper\u2019s modular design and open architecture make it well suited for networking upgrades requested by allied air forces seeking to extend the life of fourth generation aircraft in mixed fleets. The manufacturer adds that the new capability provides a cost effective path to keep these aircraft relevant in increasingly digital environments.\nAccording to the company, Sniper NTP combines onboard and offboard intelligence to give pilots clearer and more up to date situational information. It plans future demonstrations featuring multi aircraft coordination, secure video sharing and dynamic targeting handoffs to show how connected intelligence can support target identification and decision making.\nSource: Lockheed Martin."

It also provides information and control for the task group\u2019s aircraft.\n\u201cThis achievement reflects a superb cross stakeholder endeavour comprising DE&S, Royal Navy and Industry personnel who have worked collaboratively to deliver this significant milestone for the UK and marks a key achievement for the programme bringing to fruition many years of intense work.\u201d\nCaptain Colin McGannity, Carrier Air Wing and Strike Warfare Commander said:\n\u201cThe principal reason for having the ASaC capability and the Crowsnest programme to do that is for protection of the strike group against air threats and, although it doesn\u2019t fire anything to engage missiles, it\u2019s there to provide early warning to ships and particularly for the threats that ships would struggle to see themselves.\n\u201cBy getting a really capable radar up high and looking down, we\u2019re taking advantage of all the lessons that we\u2019ve learned in the past, particularly back in the Falklands War to make sure that we\u2019ve got that capability to help protect the strike group.\u201d\nCrowsnest reached Full Operating Capability at the end of March, ahead of deploying with the Carrier Strike Group \u2013 meaning it\u2019s now fully developed to ensure full protection to the task force\u2019s warships from threats such as hostile aircraft, ships or incoming drones or missiles, enabling essential command and control over an extended area.\n\u201cNow the capability is right where we need it to be,\u201d said Capt McGannity.\n\u201cThe capability is so, so important and I admire the programme team who have been focused on the mission, focused on their importance to the Carrier Strike Group and pressed on through some of the difficulties.\n\u201cWe need an airborne early warning capability to meet the threats and extend the range of what ships can see. We\u2019ve got to do that to meet the threats we face.\u201d\nThe programme has included more than just the integration of the radar and new mission system in the existing Merlin helicopter.\nIt also involves a new data link to share live tactical information with the ships below, the logistics of maintaining a fleet of aircraft at sea, and the creation of a training programme, including a new simulator at RNAS Culdrose, to prepare a corps of experienced aircrew of observers and pilots to run the system.\nCrowsnest programme director Commander James Stone added:\n\u201cThe Merlin Mk2 ASaC helicopters have now reached full operating capability and this is a hugely significant milestone.\n\u201cIt now means the \u2018eyes of the fleet\u2019 are back, doing their core job with the full ability to deliver maritime force protection from air and surface threats.\n\u201cASaC is one of three pillars of carrier strike.

    "content": "The Royal Navy\u2019s Crowsnest airborne early warning system, mounted on Merlin Mk2 helicopters, will retire as planned on 31 December 2029, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed.\nThe system is expected to achieve full operating capability next year after a spend of \u00a3425.7m.\nThe confirmation that the new Government will not be changing the decision made by the previous Government came in response to a written parliamentary question by Mark Francois, Conservative MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, who asked about the system\u2019s out-of-service date.\nMaria Eagle, Minister of State for Defence, stated: \u201cThe CROWSNEST programme delivers the Royal Navy\u2019s Merlin Mark2 helicopter Airborne Surveillance and Control capability, which includes Airborne Early Warning. There has been no change to the current out of service date, and the planned retirement date remains 31 December 2029, as the capability was not extended in the 2021 Integrated Review.\u201d\nThe Crowsnest system, operated by the Royal Navy\u2019s Merlin Mk2 helicopters, provides critical airborne surveillance and control capabilities, including early warning of airborne and surface threats.\nDespite its importance, the 2021 Integrated Review did not extend the system\u2019s service life, leaving its retirement date unchanged. The decision reflects broader strategic shifts towards next-generation technologies, though questions remain about how the capability gap will be addressed.\nThe replacement\nBy 2030, the Royal Navy plan to have moved carrier based \u2018Airborne Early Warning\u2019 capability from Merlin helicopters to \u2018Vixen\u2019 fixed wing drones.\nAccording to a presentation on the \u2018Future Maritime Aviation Force\u2019, the Royal Navy will move airborne early warning capabilities to fixed-wing carrier launched drones called \u2018Vixen\u2019. They say that this will \u201crejuvenate\u201d the Merlin fleet. Currently, airborne early warning capabilities are delivered by Merlin with \u2018CROWSNEST\u2019 pods, you can read more about that at the link below.\nThe presentation states that \u201cby 2030\u201d, the Royal Navy will have:\n\u201cAdded mass to the Carrier Wing with additional LIGHTNING and medium FWUAS (VIXEN)\u201d and \u201cwill have rejuvenated the Merlin fleet, to synchronise with replacement capabilities, transferring PWAS/AEW/Data Node to VIXEN and ASW FIND to medium RWUAS (PROTEUS)\u201d.\nThe text accompanying the \u2018By 2030\u2019 slide is as follows:\n\u201cWe will have added mass to the Carrier Wing with additional LIGHTNING and medium FWUAS (VIXEN). We will have rejuvenated the Merlin fleet, to synchronise with replacement capabilities, transferring PWAS/AEW/Data Node to VIXEN and ASW FIND to medium RWUAS (PROTEUS). Wildcat will be augmented with additional ASUW/Littoral FIND capability, also by PROTEUS.\nMaritime Protector will provide complementary support where teamed with POSEIDON in the North Atlantic. Small UAS capabilities will be spirally developed to encompass EW,UW and target training support. Successful payload and weapon integration will also be key to the success of FMAF.\nIn 2030, medium organic UAS will deliver most FIND in the Littoral and Maritime, teamed with crewed air for FIX/STRIKE, and complemented by Maritime Protector. ASW Merlin will regain mass with the transfer of AEW capability to an alternate platform. Together with enhanced FW in the Carrier Air Wing, Maritime Aviation will be reconstituted to match evolving peer threats.\u201d\nHow might the drones be launched?\nEarlier, we reported that the Ministry of Defence is currently seeking information on the potential for industry provide assisted launch and arrested recover systems for a range of air vehicles, which would be suitable to fit to a vessel within 3 \u2013 5 years.\nThe Ministry of Defence say that this request for information is to support the development of the Royal Navy\u2019s Future Maritime Aviation Force (a presentation on which is where the slide above came from) with potential for use with both crewed and un-crewed air vehicles.\nThe Ministry of Defence add that it is looking to assess the availability of electromagnetic catapult, and arrestor wire systems for the launch and recovery of air vehicles.\nWhile the Request for Information looks to assess the \u201cavailability of electromagnetic catapult and arrestor wire systems to launch aircraft\u201d from a ship, words associated with the previous effort to explore converting the vessels to \u2018CATOBAR\u2019 in order to launch carrier variant F-35Cs, it shouldn\u2019t be taken as indication that the Royal Navy are abandoning the short take off and vertical landing F-35Bs and returning to catapult launched fighters. On the contrary, they\u2019re looking to augment the F-35Bs.\nThe Royal Navy is driving hard to introduce a range of un-crewed air vehicles and to \u201cgive wider options for the use of different air vehicles types within the Fleet\u201d.\nMoney well spent when its not even fully in service yet, scrap it but still spend trying to fully field it. No wonder our Armed Forces are a mess with so much of this going on, Scrap Puma helicopters to save money then have pay for some thing to fill the gap until we buy new helicopters.\nI am fully behind scraping out of date kit if you replacing it with some thing better, but as a nation we scrap things , leave a gap or have buy in some thing to fill the gap until we order some to replace what we got rid off, its madness\nIt is hard to understand, from the outside, how this was so comprehensively messed up.\nThe initial plan was a light rework of the Sea King system with better software to control it. These appears to have got carried away into the Good Idea Club territory. So rather than do the thing in a totally modular and incremental manner it appears to have turned into a monolithic mess.\nOK IRL the project is a lot, lot more complex than it sounds because it isn\u2019t just a radar.\nIt will have cost a lot more than that when you take account of Merlin\u2019s being taken from other essential duties \u2013 T&E hours\u2026.\nI\u2019d say it will have cost \u00a31Bn in real money for four years of effective service.\nI\u2019d say a bit fat NO to a capability gap given that it make the fleet a sitting duck as we have so few P8/RIVET/E7s and we can\u2019t AAR them anyway which is daft as they are long range planes to start with.\nWith no organic AEW you don\u2019t have a CSG it us as simple as that and \u2018mitigations\u2019 don\u2019t help one jot as you can\u2019t see over the horizon.\nAgree you cannot run a carrier without AEW.\nUnfortunately Jonathan, this is typical of way we piss money against the wall.\nWe would have been better off simply retaining the Seaking AEW7 and sending the helicopters to Carsons for refurbishment and maintenance.\nIt would have been a fraction of the cost fir something that actually worked!\nWe need a fixed wing, much higher flying and long endurance system, UAV carried.\nWe never learned the lesson from the Falklands.\nYes they got rid of the gannets are\nand we lost ships\nSpot on and those sezking were rushed in ,after we had lost the Gannets when the Ark went in 79 .it seems that the MOD is run by the ethos of \u201d trow away we can manage ?\u201d It\u2019s only the Armed forces and taxpayers , Were in line for a good pension when it should be \u201d make hay whilst the sunshines make do and mend.\n2 or 4 F35s networked together can cover a huge area. And create and share in real time\na huge ISTAR picture with air and naval assets. Technology in this area has moved on massively from the Seaking AEW MK7s\nHowever, do you really want to handicap 2 to 4 F35s with maintaining a 24/7 AEW picture? Agreed technology has moved on apace. Using F35s for this role would significantly reduce the F35s fleet airframe hours and increase your maintenance burden. Not only the number of sortie changes that would be required to do 24/7 coverage. A significantly cheaper airframe, that maximizes the sortie duration, whilst being able to carry a UHF, L, S or C band radar is crucial for the CSG AEW role.\nAfter not even 1 week you don\u2019t have any F-35 in flying condition\u2026\nAt insane cost. Even 2 F-35\u2019s are going to run 50k an hour for an AEW \u2018picture\u2019.\nWe ran one in the Falklands conflict.\nRegardless of the losses, it was done.\nNo it was not. Did not arrived in time.\ndecent shipborne AEW without assisted launch & recovery is the weak point. it costs \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 to have emals, unproven during QE design. for european waters they can rely on land based AEW but not so much further a field. we wait for decent AEW drone option. my preference was a STOVL drone operating same as a F35b and partner with other F35b navies.\nSimon, General Atomics put out a story regarding their compact drone launcher via its EMALS technology, which has been successfully implemented on several United States Navy platforms. Gary Hopper, Vice President of Strategic Development at General Atomics, asserts that their EMALS configuration can effectively launch various fixed-wing drones, requiring only a takeoff distance of 22 metres. A reduction compared to the 91 metres necessary for the EMALS aircraft launcher for full size aircraft. Furthermore, the launcher occupies a minimal footprint of just 1.2m by 0.6m.\nHopper has indicated that the Royal Navy has been presented with the Gambit series of drones, designed for deployment via this EMALS system. The Gambit series comprises four collaborative combat aircraft, starting with Gambit 1, which functions as an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform. Next is Gambit 2, an air-to-air combat drone equipped with several air-to-air missiles. Gambit 3 serves as a trainer, capable of executing sorties against sophisticated U.S. systems, including integrated air defence frameworks and modern fifth-generation tactical air assets. Lastly, Gambit 4 is a stealth-optimized flying wing for combat reconnaissance, equipped with RADAR that can detect surface targets, such as a Type 45 or Type 26 ship, from up to 30 meters above sea level and has an 80 nautical mile range due to its AESA antenna, facilitating direct communication with a mother ship for Airborne Early Warning (AEW) capabilities. All variants share a common core architecture.\nGeneral Atomics claims that the EMALS system can launch the MQ-25 refuelling drone, which has been validated within the U.S. Navy\u2019s operational framework. Hopper posits that this capability would enhance the Royal Navy\u2019s ability to refuel its F-35Bs. Notably, BAE Systems has recently finalised the next-generation Vertical Motion Servo Control (VMSC) upgrade to accommodate the control surfaces required for short EMALS launches, making it compatible with the MQ-25.\nHowever, while the specifications illustrate the launcher\u2019s capabilities, the documentation lacks details regarding the recovery operations for the aircraft, I can only assume its there. The visual representation in the General Atomics EMALS article shows the launcher installed on the HMS Prince of Wales, positioned adjacent to the ski jump, but does not elaborate further on recovery protocols. Given the technological advancements, would this system be operationally viable for the Royal Navy?\nAny fixed wing non STOL aircraft will require an angled deck. Otherwise we\u2019re back to WW2 types of operations where, you can\u2019t do concurrent take-offs and landings. Plus there will need to be a lot of aircraft movements to clear the deck for landings etc. our carriers would need the modification for an angled deck, as well as the rounded down deck tail for landings. I would then fully expect arrestor wires and a barrier to be included.\nThe MoD\u2019s request for information on the catapult and arrestor system alluded to a max weight that the MQ-25 matched. Be interesting to see where it leads.\nHello DaveyB \u2013 do you think the WE class deck as designed is wide enough to accommodate an angled flight deck, or would a sponson and additional run-off be needed for recovering MQ25 sized aircraft?\nAnd if an angled landing run was installed with wires etc, would the ships be able to launch and recover simultaneously? Or would an F35 queued up to launch at heavy load obstruct recovery of the UAS, and vice versa?\nCivil servants and ministers who don\u2019t have clue other than looking at cost\nPuma is now very old and must cost an increasing amount to run. The Searchwater derived radar on the AEWC is also very old although it has got a new flashy interface. The F35 radar is better than Crowsnest. By the time it retires it will be a museum exhibit. The only way it will discover a 6 generation intruder is if it bumps into it.\nMinistry of cuts, they,re working hard to get the goal of an unarmed country.\nIs this simply face saving admission that it simply isn\u2019t up to the job?\nI don\u2019t know, but if it works, why would you not keep it until its replacement was actually being fielded? ( will vixen be up and running in that time scale?)\nNo, this is the Ministry telling us that it had a planned end of service date and that it hasn\u2019t bothered to update the plan in the last five years. It\u2019s so much easier to report out-of-date plans to Parliament than admit things have slipped. Those are the dates on the plans so no need to lie.\nIt was never going to work. Operational capability has been pushed back way to many times. Everybody from the flying World new it was bloody useless. After all these years and millions spent, things will not improve. Next years date will be fudged. For me I think it will be axed before 2029.\nSo in less than 5 years Vixen will be fully developed to take on the role of Crowsnest?\nAA\nPersonally I imagine Crowsnest will see its service extended by a couple of years as I am sure there will be a delay in getting Vixen and the catapults installed on the carriers.\nWe already have the Merlins so I cannot imagine it would be very expensive to keep a few radar sets and inflatable bags in service for a little while longer.\nI suspect your right, Vixen will be a big capability increase over crows-nest especially if supplemented by Proteus. If it\u2019s not ready in 2029 which it won\u2019t be it\u2019s pretty easy to extend the life of Crowsnest. The navy won\u2019t admit to that now as it wants project Ark Royal working ASAP.\nThat\u2019s the way I read it as well, Jim.\nI think the move to Vixen sounds pretty exciting but I\u2019m not up enough on the tech side to understand how much of a capability improvement it will be. Relying on helos for AEW was a fine stop gap but the world\u2019s moved on.\nI also wonder if we\u2019re in the middle of an accelerating tech revolution (especially for drones, electronics and AI) which means that it increasingly makes sense to move on from existing technology much earlier than before. There\u2019s no point sitting on out-dated tech and using sunk cost as a rationale for inertia.\nGeneral Atomics claims to have offered their drone launching EMALS system and the GAMBIT drone series, plus the MQ25 as a tested and working solution for the Royal Navy.\nI cannot post the link here, its on the GA and SimpleFlying websites. If correct, why wouldn\u2019t the RN snap it up?\nI suspect the RN won\u2019t snap it up because it doesn\u2019t really exist, it\u2019s just another US defence contractor with its hand out looking for development funding for a US project.\nThe QE was started to be built with cats and straps but then the Givernment decided the boot lick the yanks again and buy in the F35 at a much greater cost , so scrpped the cats and straped at another cost the the build program\nSuch a cock up, more time berthed for the QE and POW carriers whilst they retrofit a launch and retrieve system\nNo? F35s were the plan form the start, we didn\u2019t have any other naval aircraft\nTo be honest it could have been worse.\nI can imagine had we gone with CATOBAR that the accountants at the MoD and Treasury would have just navalised half our Typhoons and spread them across RAF and RN, without any additional orders!\nThat is not correct.\nQECs were designed for F35B from the off.\nThere was a hiatus when changing the design was looked at mid build.\nThe three main reason for F35B is that it is much:-\n\u2013 quicker to deck qualify a pilot with VTOL than Cat-n-traps and so much cheaper to generate force; and\n\u2013 RN could not afford a fleet of dedicated F35C; and\n\u2013 F35B can perform the ground support role of the Harrier although why you would want that these days is open to question.\nWell it\u2019s rather more nuanced. The Harrier replacement and cancellation of the \u2018Big wing Harrier\u2019 in favour of the AV-8B got us into the F-35B programme as a tier 1 contributor. That put pressure on us choosing it for our carriers and costs pressured us into concentrating and compromising on a single variation. The carriers went through various design studies presenting options offering CATOBAR, nuclear and the option we ended up with clearly influenced in the end by the above. However added to that set of circumstances and obviously complicating that is the blatant fact that had we gone for EMALS it would have been a disaster due to the technical problems and delays in that US technology. Obviously there was work on a uk system back then but how viable it was I can\u2019t judge but hardly likely costs would have looked good even if it were technologically fundamentally sound. As US and China with their resources, have had very difficult problems and years long delays it\u2019s not easy to have confidence in any uk system developing smoothly. So we either would have gone with a dated steam system which the likes of the Daily Mail would have had a field day over or gone with a EMALS system with likewise Daily Mail responses, ie a brick wall and a hard place. But the point is that in the end design for the carriers the space for CATOBAR below the deck was never removed it\u2019s still there.\nSo once the design was agreed upon, the carriers were it\u2019s true designed thereafter specifically for F-35B but their overall concept design did not change much between the various design concepts presented for each of the options proposed (some of the design options from both Thales and Bae can still be found online) and one can see from the width of the carriers only modest design changes towards the port forward area were made where the angled deck details would have modified the form in that area a little.\nAmerica Derangement Syndrome. It\u2019s always the US\u2019s fault. Get a life.\nWhere did anyone say that? Go back to your crayons.\nAMERICA, F*CK YEAH!!!\nHow goes your conquest of the America\u2019s, have they drafted you yet?\nWrong, it wasn\u2019t being built for cats and traps. The design just left space to add it as a possibility in future.\nAah now that\u2019s a very important differentiator. It was designed in general form to incorporate either with modest changes to that overall design, but once the decision was taken was further perfected in detail for STOVL and then built specifically for that purpose. The design left space for Catobar because it was flexibly designed to go in either direction right up to a late stage, with little modification at the design stage up to that point. What they (Thales or Bae) design two near completely different designs or concepts for each. The nuclear version which was discarded much earlier would have been a longer heavier ship however to accommodate that propulsion concept.\nMy understanding (admittedly from many threads on here) was that Cats & Traps was always supposed to be considered as a design option , Indeed at one point Cameron flipped from the B variant to the C variant and then shortly afterwards flopped back again. I believe that was because he baulked at the costs that were being quoted to fit Cats & Traps (However there are those that suggest the Yanks inflated those costs to keep us committed to the B) Following that at some point during the plethora of meetings the initial requirement to accommodate the space and basic design to allow retro fitting was \u2018forgotten\u2019 and we ended up with a design that can no longer retro fit Cats and Traps \u2013 thus tying us into the F35B and all its current constraints (engine power, missile compatibility etc.) if we want to continue to fly fixed wing/piloted aircraft from our carrier group.\nNow it really doesn\u2019t matter what rationale is used to justify the choice of the B variant , fitting the argument retrospectively (as if it was an inspired choice from the start) its a moot argument as there is nothing else available to us.\nI did look at the WIKI content on the UK version of EMALS which If I recollect (?) was GEC based tech- but ultimately sold off and \u2018lost to the annuls of history- The Free Market strikes again as always\u2026\nEither way regards this Crowsnest again there have been many on here suggesting it was an ill fitting choice from the start but the issue is if we do not have that functionality then the Carrier Group is pretty much blunted as a force.\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve had a plan to deliver this capability all along\u2026.\nNope, not correct.\nFunding was withheld by Defence Secretary Hutton, which added over 1 Billion to the cost, and then the incoming Tory government looked at the possibility of altering the design.\nThat was, rightly, shelved, and F35B remained the aircraft of choice.\nAs for \u201cbuying in the F35 at greater cost\u201d the UK paid billions towards the JSF R&FD program to get Tier 1 status. The ongoing industrial benefits to the UK of BAES at Samlesbury ( interestingly also the new home of the NCF ) building parts of every F35 built far exceed the costs of buying the aircraft for the UK.\nDoesn\u2019t that depend on how many F35B\u2019s we buy ?\nAlso would that also offset against the A or the C variants (I\u2019m not sure what \u2018bits\u2019 we make and what variants those \u2018bits \u2018 are used on).\nHi Daniele\nDid you see Jon Clarks point on this thread?-\n\u201cAll the mk2 Merlin\u2019s have been modified to be re-rolled to the AEW role.\nSo it means it will at least take some of the stress from ASW fleet\u201d\nThat\u2019s good news to me- the RN does need the extra ASW helo capability.\n@Grizzler. I believe we make a % of every F35 built, regardless of variant.\nHi Klonkie.\nYes, there don\u2019t seem to be any dedicated ASCS cabs like the Sea Kings were.\nThough having had 44 HM1, then 42, then only updating 30 to HM2 standard has left the Merlin fleet overstretched.\nI\u2019d take more Merlin over F35, for example.\nThe \u201cnew\u201d comment section makes accurate, direct reply awkward.\nLast I read it determined Vixen won\u2019t be available till well into the thirties.\nIsn\u2019t it about time that the MOD stopped stating definable dates for equipment to go OOS, unless that capability is to be removed total from the services. Examples that spring to mind; air launched nuclear weapons or mechanical trench digging machines.\nThe OOS date for Crowsnest is surely predicted on the introduction into service of Vixen.\nIt would be better is they stated: The OOS date remains the same (insert date), on the understanding that the new replacement system is up and running.\nIt\u2019s an odd nuance of Defence funding, but what it really means is that the funding line for operating the capability on this platform runs out at that date. What you then tend to see in the budget is the new funding line appear for the new platform / capability.\nSo, they don\u2019t actually mean planned out of service date \u2013 they actually mean that\u2019s when the current plan stops funding it.\nThey always have these OOS dates as a default. Typhoon was suppose to be OOS in 2030 then 2040 but it will be in the inventory until well after 2040.\nRetirement of a critical asset prior to even PoC testing of the replacement in just a few short years of service.\nIdiotic and a further example that the UK does not care about the military.\nIt is also laughable referring to \u201c\u2026additional Lightening\u201d, when no additional orders or statements of \u201c\u2026more than 36 Lightening onboard\u201d have been made by the Labour Government. Use of any of the before mentioned 36 F-35B that can be embarked is a reduction in strike capabilities; noting further any expansion of the F-35B numbers embarked should be to increase strike and CAP capabilities for the Fleet \u2026They (Labour Government) seem to be taking copying the modus operandi from that orange american \ud83d\ude43\nAlso, no further information on what is to become of the Crowsnest Merlin. The statement in the article is vague and doesn\u2019t confirm the re-roling of these platforms back to their initial ASW mission.\nAll the mk2 Merlins have been modified to be re-rolled to the AEW role.\nSo it means it will at least take some of the stress from ASW fleet.\nI know it was intended to modify all 30 Mk2s for Crowsnest. I haven\u2019t seen whether this was completed to all airframes and what the intention is moving forward, as I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the HMG took the opportunity to reduce the fleet further to save costs, all under the auspices to use them (the Crowsnest mods) as a source of spares\u2026. It\u2019s not like the Merlin fleet hasn\u2019t experienced that before!\nSurely the Carrier deck will need a change to CATS and TRAPS first so the can safely land these Vixen Fixed Wing Aircraft we seem to be going down the route of scrapping first with no replacement in place\nIn reality yes. We need to fully implement Ark Royal with an a\nAngled deck.\nLanding fixed wing aircraft straight down the deck was abandoned in the 1950\u2019s, for good reason!\nA British invention too!\nSome thoughts. Last I read it determined Vixen won\u2019t be available till well into the thirties. The current image for Vixen used by MoD is GhostBat whether that actually means anything is up for debate.\nAngled deck, well theoretically it could be modified for that, the width is there just the launch extension was removed from the design. In reality I find it difficult to see it happening mind for one reason or another mostly cost, but if it\u2019s for drones you could modify for an angled deck pretty much as is I suspect. More likely they will explore using the area next to the sky jump mind but the required weight of a fully fledged AEW drone may not work there so would be compromise solution I fear.\nWhat\u2019s the load out of a GhostBat as presently configured, 1000Ibs? Is it capable of a AEW fit? What mods would be required to launch it. Is it remotely suitable to the task? DaveyB it seems suggests not.\nGrizzled mentions about Cameron reconsidering fitting cats and traps during build late on and decided not to due to \u2018costs\u2019. By that time it would have meant some costly alterations in build true but I do feel as he alluded to at least part, probably substantial, of those costs was probably a barrier presented by the US because so much of our tier 1 involvement going back many years was the long standing commitment to the B version to replace our Harriers helping to make that version (which so compromised the overall F-35 design) more viable financially and helping with further potential sales elsewhere beyond the US Marines no doubt. I reckon they were quoting all manner of extra costs and punishments to back out of those initial commitments.\nDoes anybody seriously believe that a replacement can be put in place by that date?\nIt depends. There are a number of compact AESA radar and mission systems that could be integrated off the shelf into a drone as long as the Government is not too precious about \u201cMade in the UK\u201d. The two main challenges are adequate power generation to power the radar plus its systems and a suitable data link. Considering most of the serious processing will be done on the Carrier or the Type-45 in Escort the data-link issue is the most critical problem. The QE class has a woefully inadequate data-link that can\u2019t take in the vast amount of data that the F-35 can share, the addition of an AEW drone exacerbates the issue. Ideally, at the very least you would want the QE class and Type-45 to be able to take in the data from this AEW drone not forgetting that it will also need to be controlled flight wise from the Carrier.\nIs that right Fedaykin? Surely the data link and processing would be handled by a T45 that\u2019s dedicated AAW? After all, it\u2019s the T45 and not one of our Carriers that will be launching something to take out the incoming aircraft or missiles.\nWe don\u2019t yet have a fixed wing drone of a suitable size that can operate off our carriers.\nThere are potentially two drones that could fulfil the requirement. The first is the European Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (MALE RPAS), or Eurodrone. This is a twin turboprop drone that is 16m long with a 30m wingspan, to perform a similar role to the MQ-9B. It\u2019s first flight is expected in 2027. Importantly it has an endurance up to 40 hours and is supposed to reach nearly 45,000ft altitude, whilst carrying a 2300kg payload. This makes it quite a bit bigger than the MQ-9B, which is 11.7m long, with a 24m wingspan, but with a similar payload and endurance.\nThe second option is the Boeing MQ-25, which is originally intended for the air to air refuelling role. However, it will have a secondary ISTAR role. The MQ-25 is powered by a single turbofan and is 15.5m long, with a wingspan of 22.9m. Unlike the Eurodrone or the MQ-9B, its wing shape has been designed for stealthiness not aerodynamic efficiency, as you\u2019d get with a high aspect ratio wing as used by the others. The MQ-25 however has been designed for carrier/maritime ops from the outset.\nThere are number of issues that need addressing, the first is airframe size. The drone must be large enough to carry lots of fuel to give at least 24 hours coverage, but also have a sufficient payload to carry the radar plus datalink. This raises the question of what type of radar is required? It would be very easy to fit something like Leonardo\u2019s Osprey 50 X-band AESA radar to a drone. With four of these panel mounted to the airframe it will give you a 360 degree view and they don\u2019t take up much space due to the smaller antenna size. However, irrespective of Leonardo\u2019s blurb stating it can detect a target at 250 miles. It crucially does not describe what that target is. X-band radars do suffer significantly from atmospheric attenuation, which is where the air \u201cresists\u201d the EM wave passing through it. So this stated range is unlikely to be something like a cruise missile or even a fighter aircraft sized target.\nLooking at other AEW aircraft, The E2D Hawkeye uses a UHF AESA radar, the E7 Wedgetail uses a L-band AESA radar and the Saab Erieye uses an S-band AESA radar. Neither the E2D\u2019s or the Wedgetail\u2019s radar would fit the two drones mentioned. However, the Erieye radar at 9m long, might just about fit above the fuselage of the two drones. It will need a lot of CFD and wind tunnel testing to see how it interacts with the airflow that could affect the flight dynamics.\nThe second issue is detection range, what is the minimum required and against what type of target? The Erieye blurb states that it can detect fighter sized targets around 260 miles away. Clearly Saab won\u2019t publish what the fighter\u2019s RCS was when it was detected. But it will likely be greater than 1m2, as that\u2019s the norm for 4th gen fighters. Additionally Saab, don\u2019t currently have a stealthy 5/6th gen aircraft to physically test against, though modelling simulation can do probably 90% of what\u2019s required. The latest version of the Erieye radar as used on the Globaleye, has according to Saab a 70% increase in detection range over the original version. So in theory should push the detection range of a fighter sized target well over 300 miles.\nThe other problem that needs addressing, are long range air to air weapons like the Russian R37, which has a published range of 250 miles. Ideally you would want to detect the aircraft before it launches the weapon. Giving the AEW platform time to to classify the launched weapon as a valid threat and then respond to it. If the launch aircraft was a Mig-31 or even an Su-35, these have an RCS bigger than 5m2, so should be able to be detected long before they can reach the maximum release range for the R37. The Su-57 will depend on the production variant. As the latest version has a lot tighter manufacturing tolerances than the earlier ones. So its RCS is likely below 1m2, possibly 0.1m2. Which means it can get a lot closer to a radar before being detected. But how close? This will be a similar problem facing Chinese J20 with the PL17.\nIf the drone was operating an X-band radar such as the earlier mentioned Osprey. The AEW platform would not detect the launch aircraft, it should be able to detect the missile though, but likely well below 200 miles. Which then puts the AEW drone at a severe risk. Without an enormous amount of input power, X-band radars, simply do not have the effective radiated power to overcome atmospheric attenuation, which governs your detection range, especially when you require 250 miles plus detection ranges. Whereas the lower frequency UHF, L and S band radars do. As they use a lot less power to reach equivalent or further detection ranges. The problem with these radars though, is the antenna shape and size. The lower the frequency the larger the required antenna. Additionally if you want a more circular and narrow beam, then ideally you want a circular antenna array, or at least a orthogonal one, like the Arleigh Burke\u2019s SPY radars. The E7\u2019s radar has the best shape out of the three mentioned. It will deliver a better narrower and circular beam shape, whereas the other two are more flattened. However, the drone required to carry such an antenna would be huge and probably too big for a carrier deck. The UHF radar used by the E2D will give you the best detection range. But requires significantly more signal processing, especially for very small targets near to the sea. I feel the Saab Erieye radar is the best compromise for size, beam shape and detection range. However, as per the Globaleye, I would team it up with a dedicated look down/horizon search X-band radar. As X-band radar are much better at detecting really small targets (such as sea skimmers) against the sea\u2019s background, whereas, lower frequency radars struggle.\nKnowing the MoD and their past history. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a MQ-9 derivative using a X-band AESA radar, as the new all singing all dancing AEW platform. Yes, it will be better than the Merlin using Crowsnest. However, it will be a crap AEW platform, for the reasons I mentioned above. You will need at least 4 of these flying to cover the same area that a E7 Wedgetail covers for instance the Erieye, will depend on the version of the radar, but at a minimum 3. Additionally, if facing a Russian or Chinese aircraft that\u2019s carrying R37 or PL17. It won\u2019t detect the launch aircraft only the missile when it gets within a \u201ctoo close\u201d range. Which means the AEW platforms will be easy meat for our adversaries. The fundamental use case requirement, is that the AEW platform MUST be able to detect the launch aircraft before it can launch its long range air to air weapon. If it can do this, then there is time to vector the CAP to interfere with the kill chain.\nCheers Davey B- good informative post, well written!\nUnfortunately neither drone accommodates V/STOL, so they can\u2019t work off our carriers (unless the carriers are converted to CATOBAR).\nI quite like the new Embraer P600 AEW as an alternative to the Erieye (also delivering an S-Band radar, from Elta). The Elta antenna looks shorter than the Erieye\u2019s, about 4 metres, and could be an easier move to a smaller drone.\nThe kill chain of an R-37 at 250 miles is impossible unless it is also being guided/networked by a very powerful AEW platform. I don\u2019t think the Chinese have a Link-16 counterpart yet.\nI mean all this says is the last status update on crowsnest was in the 2021 IR. This isn\u2019t reporting anything else.\nChances are it will be ran until vixen is working. But there\u2019s no need to change the timing until the next IR.\nThat\u2019ll be the Merlins currently carrying Crowsnest in the bin then. The Navy won\u2019t want that, but HMT will.\nShame we gave up on our electromagnetic launcher project.\nSeaKing AEW was put together in a few weeks but then we had intelligent folks that new what was needed back then. Should have kept the SeaKing\u2019s going with an update to them as required and saved a fortune but the MOD and Service Leaders just love to burn up money for absolutely no gain, just look at all the programmes in the recent past, the RAF being great at that. The UK Armed Forces are weak and cannot even deal with peacetime requirements these days a disgrace. This Gov will add the final nails to the once proud services coffin and spend the money on their tosh ideas for the state. The UK is lost and a third world state.\nIt was very much upgraded in the following years.\nThere are plenty of people who know how to do this kind of thing.\nThe problem is the solution would appear to be over specified and not a simple lift from the old system.\nThe system developed in \u201882 was largely analogue as you couldn\u2019t physically lift a computer capable of processing that much data in \u201882. Bear in mind the size of T42 /22 computer *rooms* for similar.\nThat changed subsequently as more of the functionality became fully digital.\nI\u2019d assume that the Merlin version was fully digital which is, in itself, not a big step.\nSeaking is a very old helicopter. There is a limit (at least in modern military\u2019s), to how long you can keep some of these things going. Seakings are still flying. But if WW3 breaks out, they won\u2019t be flying long at the rate modern militaries will require them to operate.\nCrowsnest was a temporary solution to an immediate problem (serious thumbs up). The best way to fix it is to get rid of it. It is not (& never was) a good solution to the problem.\nAnd what do you offer as an alternative? Cats and traps will not be fitted to the Carriers as the cost would be as much again as building new vessels which again will not happen.\nThey have had over 40 years to come up with a better alternative but no-one is prepared to think outside the box, even though they knew the present solution was sub-par from its first iteration.\nTo be blunt, trying to follow a hastily-cobbled together solution to lack of AEW cover for the Falklands War with a permanent arrangement was a daft idea.\nAs long as Vixen is ready by 2030, all good. RN gets its Merlins back for other roles. But I am not holding my breath about that ready date\u2026..\nI agree, anything will be a big step up over Crowsnest, with a system of system based approach with Vixen and Proteus we may have a superior solution to the E2.\nManned AWACS aircraft are already very vulnerable and that will continue to get worse. The USAF is very much in favour of a system of systems approach for AEW/AWACS.\nGroundhog Day.\nThis just repeats what was planned (aspired to) in 2021 when the RFI on electro magnetic launch systems was issued. That set out an ambitious timescale of as early as 2023. 4 years later and \u2026.nothing. Not even a mature design for Vixen.\nThe most likely solution will be a Mohave UAV, able to operate without cats and traps.\nThis offers nothing new, and still many of the commentariat are moaning.\nSurely, Crowsnest is just extended a few years, if Vixen is not ready.\nIt\u2019s needed, so these Merlin can return to their core task.\nThe cut was years ago when 849 NAS Sea King ASCS7s were cut.\nExpensive for a short time in service, but better than nothing.\nI think many, like me, are\u201dmoaning \u201c that in reality, apart from testing a Mohave, nothing at all seems to have been achieved since 2021. Information on the feasibility of and cost of an EMALs system \u2013 none. Development work on a heavy UAV \u2013 none.\nFair.\nAs PeterS say not a lot of testing has occurred.\nThe idea of landing UAV\u2019s on a crowded deck doesn\u2019t fill me with optimism as it is not an angled deck.\nSo I suspect we will be an angled deck sponson added and some arrestor wires.\nBut as that hasn\u2019t started to happen and has no budget line I don\u2019t see this materialising in 2030\u2026\nYou are right about the real cut was in 2018 or so when 849 stood down. Admittedly they were worked hard in Afghanistan doing something like 3000 hours but despite what many say on here they were highly effective and valued. What is perplexing is the Crowsnest system was to be just an evolution of the well proven Cerberus tactical sensor suite and the Searchwater 2000 radar. We are now paying \u00a342m for 10 sets. The cost increase is nearing 60% from the original order. WTF has gone wrong.\nIt would have been far cheaper to extend the life of the Sea Kings with some incremental upgrades to the systems if possible.\nAs an anecdote it is quite sad seeing the old 849 set up at Culdrose but no shortage of Merlin equipped baggers.\nHi M8,\nFirstly given the timescales I can\u2019t see a Cat in Hells chance of Vixen being ready by 2030, there are some decent articles on NL about this and they indicate mid 30\u2019s, there isn\u2019t even a prototype of the Airframe yet.\nSecondly Crows Nest just isn\u2019t good enough and we desperately need those Merlins back doing what they are designed for ASW. So I woukdn\u2019t want to extend something that just doesn\u2019t do the job properly.\nThirdly to operate Vixen requires EMAL and traps and we just don\u2019t have the budget at present to convert the carriers and no idea of what to order even if we did. US have a working option and Alstom are rumoured to be getting there with an EMAL but either way it\u2019s a decade of work.\nI actually think the solution is just to speak to GA about their SeaGuardian version of the Mohave, we know it can work on a QE, it can stay up for 18 hours and can carry various radars including AESA so ask them if it can do AEW (seems able to do most things) and if it\u2019s do able in the timescale GA just happen to want a launch customer.\nMeanwhile that give us a usable capability and the breathing space to develop an enduring solution like Vixen.\nSea guardian isn\u2019t a straight forward solution in regards to the challengers of unarrested landing\nSo\u2026\nScrap Merlin Crowsnest in 4 years, to install the radars onto Vixen UAVs that currently don\u2019t exist and likely won\u2019t be built (let alone operational!) for at least 10 years, to be launched from an EMALs catapult, built for drones, that also doesn\u2019t exist and probably won\u2019t even start being built for another 5 years.\nDoes that about sum it up?\nYet another capability gap! Let\u2019s just say I wouldn\u2019t want to be a sailor on either carrier in a fight against the PLAN if it kicks off around Taiwan!\nWe seem have spent a ridicolous amounts of money on this for a few years of service- I think the Italians had a similar AEW system for the Merlin wouldn\u2019t it had been cheaper to buy this or keep Sea Kings flying as plenty of spares etc for them?\nThey scrapped that because it didn\u2019t work\nAEW is certainly an issue to be faced by other nations planning to operate the F35B from ships. A common solution would reduce costs\u2026 but would probably slow procurement too much.\nMore critical systems on drones, all not fully tested. Capability gap will be massive not a few years.\nWhy not by Osprey and fit modulised radar system, could have 3 or 4 and they could do the AEW and COD duties. MOD seems to think drones could do COD, ok for stores but what about personnel?\nOsprey is extortionately expensive, and no radar system exists for it\nWhat about AW609? They\u2019re much cheaper, around \u00a320-30 million per airframe.\nToo light.\nWould need to cancel a couple of T31s to afford this\u2026\nIn the meantime, Japan has just ordered 23 MQ-9b SeaGuardians from GA. We still have options on more Protectors and, presuming GA\u2019s work on developing the STOL kits progresses well, getting them into service by time Crowsnest is retired is not unreasonable.\nNot really safe to operate from naval vessels, have only been tested in benign conditions\nAnother capability gap coming, the replacement is odds on to be delayed to 2040.\n\u201cMaritime Protector will provide complementary support where teamed with POSEIDON in the North Atlantic. \u201d\nSo doesn\u2019t really matter if Vixen is ready or not, its only a concern for the government if the carrier will be deployed far from our shores but we\u2019re much more focused on Europe and north Atlantic going forward so delays in Vixen won\u2019t be a huge upset for the government. Also, if the SDR mothballs one carrier the other will see limited deployments most being to the NS or NA where Protestor and Poseidon can provide \u2018complementary support\u2019. All part of the plan \ud83d\ude42\nWhat \u201cplan\u201d is this? A cunning plan thought up by a fox recently appointed to a professorship for cunning at Oxford University?\u2026\nA plan so cunning, you could put a tail on it and call it a weasel.\nIt is considered best practice to write out acronyms in full the first time they are used, so the reader has half a chance of understanding what the article is talking about.\nTick.\nThank you.\nIt\u2019s all well and good if the RN can replace a Merlin with a Crowsnest radar with several Vixen drones performing AEW\u2026 but as far as I\u2019m aware the RN has yet to select the drone platform for the Vixen programme. And this is before and development required to ensure it can fulfil the AEW role.\nHaving it in service for 2030 seems optimistic at best.\nOn the surface, it seems to me like a complete and utter lack of joined up thinking. The Falklands taught us an expensive lesson regarding operating without Airborne Early Warning Radar but surely there has to be a better way to ensure there is no capability gap.\nI do question the value of the excellent UKDJ reporting all of these deflecting answers to PQs. Eagle has just regurgitated an answer from 4 years ago that tells us absolutely nothing. Maybe it would be better having a separate section to contain these QandAs rather than try to make a full article out of each of them.\nAgree, l tend to haunt a few other sites for information now. TBH this site just winds people up most of the time.\nI do tend to agree and I posted something similar a week or two ago. Unfortunately the term clickbait comes to mind.\nSo just as they get it working as it should they decide to scrap it . You couldnt make it up . It no wonder the mod has no money when it wastes it like this\nThis is nuts. Let\u2019s face it there is zero chance the replacement will be ready by 2029 if the order has not yet been placed. Leaving yet another capability gap.\nLet\u2019s hope the SDSR has a different answer to the question.\nSounds like an incoming Capability Gap.\nWhat stage is Vixen at?\nIntegration of radar and secure datalink both on the air vehicle an the RN platform(s) will be complex. Yet they are still unsure about how to launch and land it.\nCertainly it will impact QE/PW big time in terms of fitting and EMALS type solution plus some arrestor kit.\nDepends if just using the existing radars from crowsnest just attached to a different platform. If so then integration will be easier.\nFor the usual reasons they can\u2019t say this, but the reality is that these Crowsnest Merlins will stay operational far longer.\nLike this and almost every other system Vixen will not be ready in time.\nAre there any developments of AEW pods could be attached to the F35Bs themselves? Or, a more dedicated AEW \u201cBlack Jack\u201d type F35B, even an unmanned version? If not the Osprey does the newer Bell Valor have any AEW potential?\nI think it does. Better potential than anything else we are looking at, that\u2019s for sure.\nPower generation is the issue. At altitude, two PT-6\u2019s just don\u2019t have the juice. The Osprey and Hawkeye are 10mw platforms and considered on the lower end of what\u2019s viable.\nSlightly off topic but what ever happened to the Britten Islander? Would this be carrier capable but maybe not supporting AEW? LOL\nMorning Mate , how are tricks? A few still operating in Queensland? I got a ride from Bundaberg to a GB Reef island a few years ago on a BN .\nGood day Klonkie, I\u2019m still going okay here in Sydney. Hope all is well with you in NZ. I was thinking that there use to be an AEW or was it a ASW or some sort of surveillance type BN ages ago? But it might be the \u2615\ufe0f I\u2019m drinking!\nThanks Bud- all good with me ! Yep, there was an AEW BN prototype built\nWhy do you think amything happened to it? I believe it gets manufactured in the UK and Romania. Military Intelligence and Maritime Patrol is the province of the more military focused B-N Defender. There was one with a bulbous nose radome shown off at RIAT a few years ago. I think more of these have been tried out in the past, so I doubt your memory is tricking you too badly.\nThanks Jon and yes it was the one with the bulbous nose dome i was thinking of. I was wondering then if the B-N could ever be beefed up for carrier ops? Good news that its still being manufactured. Is it on the Isle of Wight?\nJust quickly looked it up. B-N reactivated in 2023 at Bembridge, Isle of Wight.\nI hadn\u2019t realized they\u2019d gone into administration last year.\nJust quickly looked it up. B-N reactivated in 2023 at Bembridge, Isle of Wight.\nI don\u2019t believe these should be beefed up for carrier ops and certainly not for AEW. It would be another constrained marginal solution; I fear MQ-9B STOL will be the same. I think we need to go to a proper hybrid STOL solution. The most mature of those at the moment is the V-280 tiltrotor, which is not optimised for duration but could deliver the necessary payload and power. It\u2019s long enough to carry an S-Band antenna and would even be capable of working from other ships. It\u2019s not a slam-dunk and we\u2019d need to pay for marinization before we even started integration work.\nA growth agenda upside is that with a centre of tiltrotor excellence, we\u2019d be well placed to deliver Bell-Leonardo tiltrotors if they win the NATO next gen rotary competition. Otherwise that will just go to Italy and the US.\nWould something like the Shadow aircraft that operates in an ISTAR role for the RAF work for the RN in an AEW role?\nDoesn\u2019t fit on/fly from/to carriers?\nCheers Davey B- good informative post, well written!\nSecond that! Brilliant!\nCheers guys. With the new comments format, it\u2019s difficult to reply to everyone. But my assumption was that the RN do go ahead with the medium weight CATOBAR installation, that falls out from the request for information (RFI) the MoD released a couple of years ago.\nTo be brutally honest, I believe the CATOBAR is the best route to go down to provide the carriers with an aircraft early warning (AEW) platform. Not so we can at an exorbitant cost buy some E2Ds. But that it gives us the opportunity to go a traditional fixed wing aircraft that can use a high aspect ratio wing (HARW) rather than a V/STOL design. The HARW (as used by the likes of MQ-9B) will allow the aircraft to cruise at an altitude above 30,000ft, plus it\u2019s more aerodynamically efficient and doesn\u2019t generate so much drag. Which significantly improves the aircraft\u2019s flight duration, as the engine isn\u2019t fighting to overcome the drag so much. The main issue with a HARW for carrier ops is the 20m+ wingspan. If the catapult was put in parallel with the ski ramp. Then there will not be a lot of clearance between the ramp structure and the wingtip. However, it would work if the \u201ccat\u201d was placed in the waist position on the port side, where the angled deck extension would be.\nThere has in the past been a lot of talk of using a tilt-rotor, such as the V22 Osprey, the V280 Valor, the V247 Vigilant or the AW609 as an AEW platform. The first issue with tilt-rotors is their service ceiling. They are generally limited to a max of 25,00ft which is down to the wing geometry and the inter-relationship with the prop-rotors. The Osprey in particular has a smaller wing surface area and prop-rotor length than it should for its weight. This is due to the manoeuvring requirement constraints it has when taxing on a Marine LHD/LHA past the island. The Valor does not have these design constraints, plus the engines are fixed in the horizontal plane and only the gearboxes transition from horizontal to vertical. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t heat up the deck like an Osprey, nor does it ingest lots of FOD when turning and burning on the ground. Sadly the AW609 design is a generation older than the Valor\u2019s, as it transitions the whole engine and gearbox assembly, when going from horizontal to vertical flight. The Vigilant has a single engine fixed in the fuselage, whilst the gearboxes then transition on the end of the wings. Neither the Osprey or the Valor have pressurized cabins, whereas the AW609 does, and the Vigilant is a drone so it doesn\u2019t matter.\nThe main point of this, is that the tilt-rotor design precludes using a HARW, which then leads to a higher fuel burn, so its flight duration is a lot less. This could be mitigated by using air to air refuelling. But when you\u2019re comparing say the Vigilant to the Eurodrone for example, it has an on-station time of 11 to 15 hours depending on what its payload weight is, whilst the Eurodrone is nudging 40 hours carrying a similar weight. Additionally the Eurodrone can cruise some 15,000ft higher, thereby give a much further extended radar horizon. This plays into the operational use of the platform and how often you need to replace it or replenish its fuel. If the Eurodrone could be mid-air refuelled, how much longer could it stay on station? These are the types of questions the requirements managers for the Merlin/Crowsnest replacement need to be asking. Which then dictates the path on which they\u2019d be taking to provide a carrier group with 24/7 coverage.\nLike I mentioned above, you want an aircraft that has the biggest radar coverage footprint, as that minimizes the number of platforms you require to be flying at once, whilst giving you a decent stand-off detection range. For example a single E2D Hawkeye can detect a fighter sized target over 350 miles away, according to published data (It\u2019s more likely going to be closer to 400 miles due to it using a UHF type radar). A Ford class carrier normally carries 5 Hawkeyes. However, the Hawkeye has a relatively short 5 hours on-station time, so up until recently, it had to be replaced by another E2D and so on to provide 24/7 coverage. Recently for the E2D, it has had the mid-air refuelling capability added, which for operations could nearly double its on-station time. The issue for the Hawkeye, is crew fatigue. There\u2019s not enough room on board for a dedicated crew rest area or to carry a spare crew. Which is where the unmanned drone has the advantage. But having the potential to have two aircraft flying extended sorties significantly extends the area to be covered by the radar. Compare that to how many Crowsnest/Merlins the QE\u2019s carry and the area each of them covers? Pretty pitiful if I am being truthful.\nFor me, I believe drone based AEW, especially for carriers is the future. The main reason is the longer flight durations compared to manned aircraft. Therefore, either more aircraft can be used during the day to cover a much greater area, or less overall aircraft could be needed but stay up for longer. Though that\u2019s wholly dependent on the radar that\u2019s be used! If for example a QE carrier carried 5 of the Eurodrones with the latest Erieye radar. It would allow the ship to rotate drones around the carrier group, as well as a drone nearer the expected threat direction. Thereby almost doubling the expected threat vector being covered.\nThe use of drones being operated beyond the line of sight is fully mature now. The data-link via satellite has proven fairly robust and its antenna location pointing upwards, means its fairly secure from being detected. But it does raise the question of how much \u201craw data\u201d could be passed via the satellite? As its very unlikely for the signal processing to be done on the drone, due to the lack of available space. The type of signal processing required for a multifunction radar, that is scanning the skies as well as the sea, looking for very small and fleeting targets, will require a dedicated cooling system, which not only adds weight and complexity, but now becomes a thermal hot spot, that would require controlling to mitigate thermal detection. By off-loading the signal processing aspect, a shed load of weight and space is saved, which can be better used for fuel, plus you don\u2019t have to manage the thermal signature as much. Shipborne signal processing in this instance makes more sense, be that from the carrier or a type 45. Especially as there\u2019s more space for a dedicated high performance computer with additional signal processing racks. But also any cooling requirements can be handled via a decent sized heat exchanger.\nI guess the bigger question, is will the MoD really do anything with the CATOBAR RFI. This path will give the MoD better options for a carrier based AEW aircraft. Whereas a VSTOL (tilt-rotor) based AEW aircraft, will definitely be better than what the Merlin and Crowsnest can provide. But it is still a compromise, whereas a drone with a HARW that is launched and recovered using CATOBAR, could provide significantly better performance and coverage.\nWe don\u2019t have enough kit of any sort. The russians and Ukrainians have shown old kit is more valuable than no kit so keep it. We are losing men at an astonishing rate because they are under paid, I\u2019ll equipped, we are filtering out young white men who want to join as not diverse enough and protecting anyone that did their job it\u2019s a bloody mess and frankly we need to start with scrapping ALL MPs, the labour part, the conservatives party and every single civil servant, judge and policeman in the country and starting again. The rot is too far in for any gentler tactics.\nCrowsnest is fine, it\u2019s Merlin that\u2019s the problem\nExplain.\nCorrect and the fact we asked Leonardo to install it\u2026..\nIf you gave MOD the Jamey\u2019s to a brewery, they\u2019d lose them, then spend more than the brewery was worth to buy a replacement set.\nMerlin Fleet out of service date is 2030.\nCrowsnest was only ever a stop gap as the Lockheed Martin Pod system was not fully developed @ the time.\nCrowsnest was seen as a shorter better term option, which Leonardo then destroyed the 3 test airframes by not protecting them.\nWas supposed to upgrade the Baggies system and transfer to the Merlin, but Carbon fibre is not as flexible as Aluminium and the swing bracket and drag of the dome were damaging the airframe.\nAgain the defence experts lied and the customer has to pay. F35s can see further and great numbers than the Crowsnest STOP GAP only\n\u00a3425.7m on a project that lasts 4 years!!! No wonder there is no money left in the budget for ship\u2019s, S/ms and RFA new builds or maintenance!! Disgraceful."

    "content": "The $5T global farming industry still relies on the observations of human scouts to determine crop conditions. This labor-intensive and error-prone method contributes to >50% over-application of costly and environmentally harmful inputs, missed indicators of emergent conditions that suppress yields, and a limited ability to forecast crop performance or optimize farming practices.\nSlantRange solves the agricultural information problem with its patented technologies in low-altitude remote sensing and edge analytics; enabling more efficient, automated, and environmentally responsible farming through targeted crop measurement and data delivery.\nWe interviewed Matt Barre, Director of Strategic Development at SlantRange to learn more about their vision, their business and what makes them a successful remote sensing startup. Enjoy reading the interview \ud83d\ude42\n- Matt, SlantRange founder\u2019s all have prior experience working in the defense sector building sensors for a totally different kind of drone. What made them take the leap of faith into entrepreneurship and start SlantRange?\nOur two co-founders, Mike Ritter and Mike Milton, as well as myself and several other colleagues here at SlantRange, had been working together at General Atomics for almost a decade designing, testing, and deploying a variety of remote sensing and advanced analytics solutions for the Predator family of unmanned systems in defense applications. This included hyperspectral, multispectral, thermal, LIDAR, active/passive imaging systems as well as all of the data processing and visualization tools required to support these sensors.\nAbout 6 years ago, Ritter and Milton saw the increasing trend of using drones for commercial applications as an excellent opportunity to apply their expertise in remote sensing and analytics to address a new market. While there were several verticals to explore, agriculture represented a massive market opportunity where this new technology could bring valuable new information and new levels of efficiency to tasks that were currently being conducted with manual labor.\nThey quickly developed a few prototypes and began testing them with a small network of corn and soybean growers in Nebraska. Those growers were immediately impressed, became the initial investors, and SlantRange was born.\n- SlantRange\u2019s main product is your multispectral sensor (backed by your suite of remote sensing analytics products). Multispectral sensors aren\u2019t something new though. How is the SlantRange sensor different and better?\nIndeed, multispectral sensing has been used in agriculture for quite some time, primarily from satellites. The various biochemical characteristics of plants that can be inferred from spectral signatures and indices are very well established. However, relatively recent advancements in camera technology have enabled these sensors to be small enough, light enough, and cheap enough to be practical for use on small low-altitude drones.\nAt SlantRange, we are strongly committed to the accuracy of our sensors as the value of the data products we produce are of course completely dependent on the accuracy of the raw data from our sensors. One example is our radiometric calibration, the process we use to normalize our measurements under changing sunlight conditions. Our sensors measure the amount of light that is reflected by a plant in multiple narrow spectral bands to derive various metrics about the health of the plant. But in order to do this accurately, we need to know the intensity and spectral content of the incident sunlight. We achieve this with our Ambient Illumination Sensor (AIS), which is mounted on top of the aircraft and measures the sunlight characteristics in real-time during the flight. These measurements are used to calibrate the reflectance measurements from the crop, producing completely normalized measurements that can be compared over time.\nAs an example, if you collect a map of a field without this sunlight calibration technique and then collect another map a week later and the crop looks different, you don\u2019t know if the crop health has actually changed or if the differences are just due to different sunlight conditions. With our calibration technique, all of the measurements are on a normalized scale and can be accurately compared over time, allowing our customers to conduct more advanced analysis, such as evaluating trends, forecasting, etc.\nWe now have 3 issued patents on this calibration technique and we consider it a foundational technology for airborne imaging and analytics in agriculture.\n- At a time when every single company out there is trying to get their application running on the cloud, SlantViewTM \u2013 your analytics platform is something that doesn\u2019t even need the internet to work. Why is that?\nAerial imaging systems generate large volumes of data very quickly. Even when a high-speed internet connection is available, it can take quite a long time to upload the imagery for processing in the cloud. And within the agriculture sector, you simply can\u2019t rely on the availability of an internet connection at all. So very early on, we decided to pursue an edge-compute architecture for our solutions. This includes some pre-processing that is completed on the sensor itself (each of our sensors include a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor) with the balance of the analytics completed in SlantViewTM, running completely offline on a laptop or tablet.\nThis edge-compute processing model has been at the core of our analytics engine since the beginning has been a big contributor to our market traction across the globe. We\u2019re now operating in over 45 countries, including many locations that don\u2019t have access to high-speed internet connections.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that we certainly appreciate the value and power of cloud-based analytics when a connection is available. We have integrated with several cloud-based farm management platforms that allow users to aggregate our data with other farm data such as soil data, weather data, and satellite data to establish more comprehensive insights about their operations.\nWe have also partnered with Microsoft to integrate their Azure IoT Edge services into our platform to seamlessly ingest, manage, and analyze data from large networks of distributed sensors. Custom analytics, as well as automated machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, can be deployed both in the cloud and at the edge with this new architecture.\n- SlantRange has been working quite closely with DJI and recently you launched the 3PX sensor that is specifically meant for DJI drones. Could tell us more about the sensor and your partnership with DJI.\nWe announced our partnership with DJI in March of 2018 with the launch of our 3PX sensor. DJI approached us several months earlier to be a launch partner for their Payload SDK, which allows 3rd party payloads to integrate seamlessly with the DJI Matrice 200 Series drones, their workhorse platform for enterprise applications. The 3PX uses the DJI SKYPORT, a custom mounting interface, to mount directly to the drone just like any other DJI camera. The interface also provides power to the 3PX, eliminating the need for any external power cables or batteries to power the sensor. And most importantly, the interface includes a real-time data connection between the 3PX sensor and the operator on the ground, using the existing data link between the drone and controller.\nYou can learn more about the 3PX and our partnership with DJI in this webinar.\n- As a company that counts farmers among your (angel) investors, I\u2019d guess that convincing farmers of the benefits of remote sensing was the easy part. What has been your biggest engineering challenge in building sensors for drones?\nOur biggest engineering challenges typically arise from the conscious decision we made very early on to not be involved with the drone hardware itself. Our expertise is in remote sensing and analytics so we chose to focus our efforts in these areas. However, this leaves us very dependent on the other hardware and software vendors in the drone ecosystem. Our users have a wide variety of applications and use cases so we\u2019re often challenged to ensure that our systems are compatible with as many platforms as possible. We achieved this by pursuing a self-contained architecture for our sensors, which include their own navigation system, data storage system, data triggering system, and several other features that allow them to operate completely independently from the drones that carry them.\nSlantRange Team Photo\nIn terms of integration, we\u2019ve developed simple and robust mounting kits for many of the most popular drones and our partnership with DJI resulted in a tightly integrated solution for their DJI Matrice 200 Series of drones.\nWe have also pursued several custom integrations with the flight planning apps used to autonomously fly the drones used with our sensors. This includes configuration of the flight planner based on our sensor parameters as well as the automatic detection, configuration, and real-time feedback included with the 3PX sensor.\n- Collecting quality remote sensing data isn\u2019t an easy task. How do you ensure that farmers who are flying their drones equipped with SlantRange sensors aren\u2019t doing something wrong? How do you let them know that something isn\u2019t correct before they spend a few hours collecting the data only to find out the data isn\u2019t useful?\nAs a starting point, we provide a full onboarding process to each of our customers to ensure they are familiar with the hardware setup as well as the data collection and data processing workflows. We also offer a more in-depth training course for those who prefer more personalized instruction, which also includes a detailed introduction to our suite of analytics.\nWe\u2019ve always provided some quick-look tools in our software that allow our customers to evaluate the area coverage of a flight and to check for any gaps immediately after a data collection. We\u2019re also implementing some new features that analyze the image content for quality metrics such as exposure and focus. However, these are all tools that are used after a flight has been completed.\nOur 3PX sensor provides real-time feedback to the user to ensure they\u2019re collecting high quality data. These real-time metrics include the status of the sensor\u2019s navigation system, the status of the data storage system and, most importantly, measurements from the AIS. If lighting conditions drop too low for quality data, the user will be notified immediately, allowing them to make the decision to abort the mission if they choose. All of this information is transmitted using DJI\u2019s Payload SDK and is displayed in real-time on the same mobile device used to operate the drone.\n- You also recently announced an additional service that is frankly quite interesting \u2013 \u201cAerial Phenotyping\u201d. What is that all about? Could you tell us more!\nOver the past several years, we\u2019ve seen increasing interest in using our sensors and analytics for very specific applications within the agriculture research community. Much of the in-field research is conducted using test plots, which are arrays of small plots, typically a few rows of plants wide and only several meters long, that are laid out in a grid pattern across a test site. Each of the plots may contain a different seed hybrid, treatment program, or both, with the intent to evaluate the performance of the crop across a season.\nPhenotyping involves the measurement of the various metrics about the crop to support the goals of the trial. This has traditionally been a manual process and can be very time-consuming, expensive, and prone to error. We saw an opportunity to customize our data collection and processing workflows to provide this data from an aerial platform in an automated and repeatable way. This included some enhancements to our navigations system, including the integration of RTK GPS, as well as some customization of our analytics to accurately assign the contributions of each image to the appropriate plots within the trial.\nThis led to the launch of our Aerial Phenotyping services. The service includes the collection of the imagery over the trial, typically multiple times over the course of a season, and the tabulated results are delivered to the customer for each and every plot within the trial, including metrics such as plant counts, plant size distributions, chlorophyll index, vegetation fraction, NDVI, stress values, yield potential, and other custom analytics based on the needs of the customer. This provides a turnkey solution for our customers who can focus on the results and their research rather than the process of collecting and processing the data itself. We are now going into our 3rd season of the service and are proud to support the research of companies such as Bayer, BASF, Land O\u2019Lakes, Syngenta, and AgReliant.\n- As a key player in a successful startup, I am sure that there are many things that you must have learnt along the way. What was the most interesting feedback that you received so far?\nOne of our advisors once told us to do things that don\u2019t scale in order to learn how to scale. While it seems a bit counter-intuitive, it actually makes a lot of sense. His point was that you sometimes have to be hyper-focused on a particular customer segment, or even a specific customer, to learn what it takes to delight your broader customer base. This may involve some completely unscalable approaches or methods but from that process you can begin to establish more scalable ways to achieve the same outcome.\nAs an example, we learned early on that the range of data needs and use cases across all of our customers is immense. We often had customers asking us to develop customized algorithms to detect the particular crop conditions they cared about. One of our customers in Southern California wanted us to develop an algorithm to detect dodder, a parasitic weed that was causing significant damage in their alfalfa fields. Through the process of developing the algorithm, which was very specific to that weed and not scalable to other crops, we developed and launched our Smart DetectionTM tool. This feature allows a user to draw a region of interest around an anomaly on one of their maps and the software uses the spectral signature from that region to find occurrences of the same feature across the entire field. Our customers have successfully used this tool to identify weeds, irrigation leaks, and lodged plants, and the applications continue to expand every day.\n- More often than not it takes a while to find a business model that works for you and your clients. Have you cracked that code already?\nWhile our business model may evolve as we continue to grow, our current model is serving us quite well. Our business is currently divided into two parts. First, we sell our sensors and subscriptions to our SlantViewTM software to growers, agronomists, drone service providers, and drone system integrators. Second, we provide data analytics services on a contract basis, which includes our Aerial Phenotyping service. The analytics we develop through our data services will typically flow into our commercial SlantViewTM software to expand and enhance the capabilities of that business unit.\n- You are based in San Diego, how\u2019s the startup scene? Are there many investors specifically looking at Ag-tech companies? Are there any local meetups/events that cater to the geo community?\nThe startup scene in San Diego is definitely thriving and continues to expand. It\u2019s establishing itself as a desirable alternative to Silicon Valley for both investors, new companies, and talent. It\u2019s definitely expanding beyond its history of biotech and defense with many new startups in both Agtech as well as B2B SaaS services.\nSan Diego is also well-known for its expertise in remote sensing, robotics, and unmanned systems, partially due to the concentration of defense technology companies and earth sciences research. While I don\u2019t know of any specific geo events, there are certainly events focused on robotics and unmanned systems, which include the automation and navigation aspects of those systems.\n- Okay, this is a tricky one \u2013 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how geoawesome do you feel today?\nWe\u2019re developing a new RTK navigation system to support our more advanced analytics and we\u2019re seeing great results so I\u2019ll say I\u2019m feeling a solid 9 on the geoawesome scale; I\u2019ll give it a 10 when it launches!\n- Any closing remarks for anyone looking to start their own geo startup?\nIf anyone would like to reach you, what would be the best way to do so?\nOne piece of advice I can offer, which has been shared many times before, if you\u2019re not completely embarrassed by your first product launch, you waited too long!\nYou can reach us any time at info@slantrange.com. We also have some great content on our blog, YouTube channel, Facebook page, and Twitter feed.\nThanks so much!\nThe Next Geo is supported by Geovation:\nLocation is everywhere, and our mission is to expand its use in the UK\u2019s innovation community.

Shield AI will similarly provide autonomy for Anduril\u2019s YFQ-44A, the source said. Aviation Week first reported the wins by RTX and Shield AI.\nThe Air Force previously disclosed that the service had winnowed the pool of autonomy vendors to five unnamed companies, though officials have since declined to disclose specifics. One source said that ensuing competition knocked out Anduril, which was competing for the autonomy deal separate from its aircraft offering.\nAn Air Force spokesperson declined to comment, saying only that \u201call subcontractors are protected by enhanced security measures.\u201d\nAnduril, General Atomics, RTX and Shield AI all referred queries to the Air Force.\nThe Air Force previously awarded contracts for the drone wingmen airframes to General Atomics and Anduril last year, marking the first \u201cincrement\u201d of the CCA program. General Atomics\u2019s YFQ-42A more recently took to the skies for its first flight. Anduril\u2019s YFQ-44A is expected to follow in October, Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told reporters in a roundtable on Monday.\nAlthough Anduril missed a target to fly the drone by the summer, Diem Salmon, the company\u2019s vice president for Air Dominance and Strike, said the firm is still \u201cwell ahead of the program schedule\u201d to achieve its maiden flight.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a little bit more on the software development side that needs to get wrung out. So that\u2019s what\u2019s currently driving our schedule right now,\u201d Salmon said during a briefing with reporters on Monday. \u201cBut again, I think that\u2019s going to allow us to kind of leapfrog the overall test plan, because we are kind of tackling that hard part first.\u201d\nDetails about the second CCA increment are still not known. Meink said Monday the Air Force is still in the \u201clearning phase\u201d for the CCA program, where efforts under the first increment will inform its subsequent iteration."

Our inwuiry follows a DoD announcement published on september 29th awarding the Lockheed Martin Corporation with a latest aircraft lot order. In our query, we are injecting part of the announcement in order to provide enough context to our INSIGHT system.\nThe initial query:\nUsing the appended announcement you will provide me the complete 2029 F-35 order of battle for the USAF by manufacturing lot number and aircraft Block configuration. the announcement : This modification provides for the definitization of 148 Lot 18 aircraft, and adds scope for the production and delivery of 148 lot 19 aircraft, to include 40 F-35A aircraft for the Air Force, 12 F-35B and eight F-35C aircraft for the Marine Corps, nine F-35C aircraft for the Navy, 13 F-35A and two F-35B aircraft for F-35 cooperative program partners, and 52 F-35A and 12 F-35-B aircraft for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. Work will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas (57%); El Segundo, California (14%); Warton, United Kingdom (9%); Cameri, Italy (4%); Orlando, Florida (4%); Nashua, New Hampshire (3%); Baltimore, Maryland (3%); San Diego, California (2%); Nagoya, Japan (2%); and various locations outside the continental U.S. (2%), and is expected to be completed in August 2028\nBelow is the integral system output.\nF-35A USAF Order of Battle: September 30, 2029\nF-35A USAF Order of Battle: Projected End-State as of September 30, 2029\nLeveraging dual-channel ingestion of the provided contract modification announcement (Lots 18-19, covering 148 aircraft each, with 40 F-35As for USAF in Lot 19), DoD Selected Acquisition Reports (SARs, Dec 2023 baseline), FY2025-2029 procurement plans, and Lockheed Martin production schedules (Lots 15-19 finalized; Lot 20 in prep), we project the USAF F-35A fleet at approximately 664 operational airframes by the end of FY2029 (September 30, 2029). This accounts for ~721 total procured airframes, adjusted for 1-4 annual attritions (SAR estimates: 2 in FY2025, 3 in FY2026-2028, 4 in FY2029) and phased upgrades to Block 3F and partial Block 4 (B4) configurations via TR-3 hardware (standard in Lots 15+, starting 2024) and software spirals. Full Block 4 rollout is delayed to 2031 (per GAO, Sep 2025), so the 2029 fleet reflects Block 3F dominance with early B4 capabilities (e.g., enhanced EW, APG-85 radar, AARGM-ER integration).\nKey Assumptions (FedRAMP/IL5-hardened, pgvector-embedded RAG):\n- Procurement Baseline: ~419 F-35As in USAF inventory at FY2023 end. FY2025-2029 adds ~302 airframes (average 60/year, aligned with SAR: 42/25/39/44/48). Lot 19\u2019s 40 F-35As (per announcement) are USAF-specific, with Lot 18 prorated at ~50 USAF (55% of 163 total F-35As across services/FMS).\n- Production Scope: Lot 18 (148 aircraft, mixed variants) definitized; Lot 19 (148 aircraft, including 40 USAF F-35As) adds scope, with deliveries completing August 2028. Lot 20 (projected 2028-2029) assumes ~48 USAF F-35As (consistent with FY2029 budget).\n- Block Configuration: Lots 1-14 (pre-2024) are Block 3F (upgradable). Lots 15+ incorporate TR-3 hardware, enabling partial B4 by 2027 (2025 software drop). Full B4 delayed to 2031; retrofits lag 5-10% due to supply chain constraints (e.g., titanium shortages).\n- Attrition and Availability: ~57 airframes lost/retired by 2029 (SAR baseline). Operational availability target: 80% (from 70% in FY2024). Edge inference ensures sub-3-second latency for MTBF forecasting.\n- Operational Context: Fleet supports multi-domain operations (e.g., JADC2 integration, AWACS ROI via datalinks), with 70% forward/rotational deployments (Indo-PACOM/Europe). Excludes test airframes (~24 at Eglin/Nellis).\nFleet Summary by Manufacturing Lot and Block Configuration\nThe following table details the USAF F-35A inventory by manufacturing lot and Block configuration as of September 30, 2029, incorporating the Lot 18-19 announcement (40 USAF F-35As in Lot 19, ~50 in Lot 18).\nSquadron-Level OOB (End-2029)\nThe ~664 operational F-35As are distributed across 14 active-duty squadrons and 6 ANG/Reserve wings, supporting ~20 operational units. Deployment focus: 70% forward/rotational (Indo-PACOM/Europe) for multi-domain operations (e.g., JADC2-linked swarm rehearsals, AWACS ROI via datalinks).\n| Wing/Squadron | Base | F-35As (Block Config) | Primary Role |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 33rd FW (58/59/60 FS) | Eglin AFB, FL | 72 (3F / ~50% Partial B4) | Training/OT&E; Block 4 spiral lead. |\n| 388th/419th FW (4/34 FS) | Hill AFB, UT | 96 (3F / ~40% Partial B4) | Air superiority; F-22/B-21 integration. |\n| 53rd WG (Test) | Eglin/Nellis AFB, FL/NV | 24 (Partial B4) | Block upgrades; ECU engine testing (2029 IOC). |\n| 56th FW (21/61/62/63 FS) | Luke AFB, AZ | 96 (3F) | Pilot training; ANG surge capacity. |\n| 355th WG (21/354 FS) | Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ | 48 (Partial B4) | Agile Combat Employment; desert ops. |\n| 366th FW (22/34 FS) | Mountain Home AFB, ID | 48 (3F / Partial B4) | Bomber escort; B-21 synergy. |\n| 493rd FS (\u201cGrim Reapers\u201d) | RAF Lakenheath, UK | 24 (Partial B4) | NATO deterrence; V Corps rotations. |\n| 509th FW (13/31 FS) | Whiteman AFB, MO | 48 (3F) | Nuclear DCA; B-2/B-21 integration. |\n| ANG: 113th/121st/144th/158th/177th/184th WGs | DC/OH/CA/VT/AT/NJ/AR | 180 (3F dominant) | Homeland defense; surge to 200+ with activations. |\nOperational Impacts: The 664 F-35As support ~50,000 annual sorties (16,000 flight hours baseline, +20% via partial B4). Partial B4 enhances EW by 25% against peer threats (e.g., J-20 analogs), but full B4 (2031) is critical for ECU-powered UCAV orchestration. Lifecycle O&S cost: $11K/flight hour target; $16.5B Block 4 cost (GAO 2023, +56% overrun). Lot 19\u2019s 40 F-35As (delivered by Aug 2028) bolster Indo-PACOM rotations (e.g., 35th FW, Misawa AB), aligning with swarm-rehearsal use cases.\nFleet Summary by Manufacturing Lot and Block Configuration\nThe following table details the USAF F-35A inventory by manufacturing lot and Block configuration as of September 30, 2029, incorporating the Lot 18-19 announcement (40 USAF F-35As in Lot 19, ~50 in Lot 18).\n| Lot # | Delivery Years | USAF F-35As Procured | Block Config (2029) | Notes/Operational Role |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1-4 (LRIP) | 2008-2012 | 32 | Block 3F | Early training fleet (Eglin AFB, 33rd FW).

Full B4 delayed to 2031 (GAO, Sep 2025).\n- Operational Impact: 664 airframes enable ~50,000 annual sorties (+20% from 16,000 flight hours in FY2024). Partial B4 adds 25% EW gain vs. peer threats (e.g., J-20). O&S cost: $11K/flight hour target ($16.5B Block 4 overrun, GAO 2023).\n- Risks: Supply chain (titanium) could delay 5-10% deliveries; retrofit lag for B4. Sub-3s edge inference for MTBF critical.\nOur observations: sensing that something was missing regarding the F-35 Block listings, we came up with a follow query asking why there was no mention of the F-35 TR-3 configurations (in fact we had missed that the TR-3 configuration was mentioned in the Notes).\nOur follow up query was : no Block TR3 configured aircraft appear on your list. Why is that?\nBelow is the system output:\nClarification on Absence of Block TR-3 Configured Aircraft in 2029 F-35A USAF Order of Battle\nThe absence of explicitly labeled \u201cBlock TR-3\u201d configured aircraft in the provided 2029 F-35A USAF Order of Battle stems from the specific nomenclature and configuration progression used in the F-35 program, as informed by dual-channel ingestion of DoD Selected Acquisition Reports (SARs, Dec 2023), Lockheed Martin production schedules, and the provided Lot 18-19 contract announcement. Below, we address this question with analyst-grade insight, adhering to the INSIGHT playbook\u2019s ops_static context-stack and FedRAMP/IL5-compliant data handling.\nWhy Block TR-3 Does Not Appear as a Distinct Configuration:\nThe term \u201cTR-3\u201d (Technology Refresh 3) refers to a hardware and software upgrade package introduced to enable the transition from Block 3F to Block 4 capabilities, rather than a standalone Block configuration. TR-3 is not a final Block designation like Block 3F or Block 4 but an interim enabler. Here\u2019s the reasoning, grounded in the data:\n- TR-3 as a Hardware Baseline:\n- TR-3 hardware, introduced in Lots 15+ (starting 2024), includes upgraded processors, memory, and displays to support Block 4\u2019s advanced capabilities (e.g., APG-85 radar, enhanced EW, AARGM-ER integration). Per the Lot 18-19 announcement, aircraft delivered in 2026-2028 (including 40 USAF F-35As in Lot 19) incorporate TR-3 hardware as standard.\n- However, TR-3 hardware alone does not constitute a distinct Block configuration. Instead, it enables aircraft to operate in Block 3F initially, with software updates enabling \u201cpartial Block 4\u201d (B4) capabilities by 2027 (e.g., 2025 software drop, per GAO Sep 2025).\n- Block Configuration Terminology:\n- In the 2029 OOB, aircraft are categorized as either Block 3F or Partial Block 4 based on their operational software and capability state:\n- Block 3F: Full envelope for Lots 1-14 (pre-2024) and some Lots 15-17 aircraft not yet upgraded to partial B4. These are fully operational but lack TR-3\u2019s advanced computing.\n- Partial Block 4: Aircraft with TR-3 hardware (Lots 15-20, including Lot 18\u2019s ~50 and Lot 19\u2019s 40 USAF F-35As) running early Block 4 software (e.g., enhanced EW, sensor fusion). Full Block 4 is delayed to 2031 (GAO, Sep 2025), so 2029 aircraft are not yet fully B4-compliant.\n- Since TR-3 is a hardware enabler, not a final operational configuration, it is subsumed under \u201cPartial Block 4\u201d for Lots 15-20 in the OOB. Explicitly labeling aircraft as \u201cBlock TR-3\u201d would misalign with DoD\u2019s Block-based reporting (e.g., SARs).\n- Production and Upgrade Dynamics:\n- All USAF F-35As delivered in Lots 15-20 (2024-2029, including Lot 19\u2019s 40 aircraft completing Aug 2028) are built with TR-3 hardware, per the contract announcement\u2019s scope for Lots 18-19 production in Fort Worth, TX, and other sites.\n- Older Lots (1-14, ~377 airframes) remain Block 3F unless retrofitted with TR-3 hardware (e.g., ~50% of 33rd FW\u2019s training fleet by 2029). Retrofit lag (5-10% due to supply chain constraints, e.g., titanium shortages) limits full TR-3 proliferation, but Lots 15+ (including Lot 18-19) are natively TR-3-equipped, hence classified as Partial B4 in the OOB.\n- The absence of a \u201cBlock TR-3\u201d label reflects this: TR-3-equipped aircraft are operationally Partial B4 by 2029, as their software defines mission capability.\n- Operational Context:\n- By 2029, the ~664 operational USAF F-35As (~377 Block 3F, ~287 Partial B4) reflect TR-3\u2019s role in enabling Partial B4 for Lots 15-20 (~283 airframes, including Lot 18\u2019s ~50 and Lot 19\u2019s 40). These support multi-domain ops (e.g., JADC2-linked swarm rehearsals) with 25% EW gains vs. peer threats (e.g., J-20 analogs).\n- Edge inference (sub-3s latency) confirms TR-3\u2019s MTBF improvements (~15% reduction in avionics failures) are captured under Partial B4\u2019s operational metrics, not as a separate Block.\nRevised OOB Clarification:\nThe provided OOB table accurately reflects TR-3 integration:\n- Lots 15-20 (2024-2029): All ~283 USAF F-35As (including Lot 18\u2019s ~50 and Lot 19\u2019s 40) are TR-3 hardware-equipped, labeled as \u201cPartial Block 4\u201d due to their 2025-2027 software upgrades enabling early B4 capabilities (e.g., DAS v2, Meteor/Stormbreaker integration).\n- Lots 1-14: Remain Block 3F (~377 airframes), with ~50-60 retrofitted to TR-3/Partial B4 by 2029 (e.g., 33rd FW\u2019s training fleet).\n- No aircraft are labeled \u201cBlock TR-3\u201d because TR-3 is a hardware prerequisite, not an operational Block designation. Total operational fleet: ~664 airframes after ~57 attritions.\nValidation Against Announcement:\nThe Lot 18-19 announcement (40 USAF F-35As in Lot 19, ~50 prorated for Lot 18) aligns with the OOB\u2019s inclusion of these aircraft under Partial B4, as they are TR-3-equipped and delivered by August 2028, supporting Indo-PACOM rotations (e.g., 35th FW, Misawa AB).\nThis answer fully satisfy our inquiry regarding the sometimes confusing F-35 block 3F incorporating the TR-3 upgrade"

The FAA\u2019s transition to IP-based networks by 2028 aims to enhance data reliability and cybersecurity.\nActive Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, such as Leonardo\u2019s Osprey 30, enable multi-functionality for surveillance and threat detection. Dual-use advancements, including National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR\u2019s) USD 91.8 million authorized program analysis reports (APARs), support military and weather forecasting applications. Strategic collaborations, including Lockheed Martin-Rheinmetall\u2019s joint venture and the BAE Systems-Hensoldt merger, are reducing costs and enhancing radar capabilities. AI and machine learning integration, as observed in the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Cognitive Algorithm Deployment System, tends to improve real-time threat analysis. These innovations are poised to meet rising defense and civilian demands, thus driving significant airborne radar market growth.\nIntegration of UAVs and AI/ML in Defense/Surveillance to Propel Increased Demand for Compact and High-Precision AI-integrated Systems\nSource: Fortune Business InsightsThe rapid proliferation of UAVs in defense and surveillance, driven by escalating geopolitical conflicts, is increasing the demand for compact, high-precision AI-integrated systems. The U.S., China, and Iran, are deploying drones for reconnaissance, precision strikes, and asymmetric warfare, with examples including Iran\u2019s Shahed-136 and Russia\u2019s Lancet reshaping battlefield tactics. Cost-effective drones (USD 1,000\u201350,000) threaten high-value assets, prompting investments in countermeasures such as the U.S. Army\u2019s AN/APR-39E(V)2 radar and L3Harris\u2019 AMORPHOUS software for controlling drone swarms. The FAA\u2019s USD 18.5 Billion Air Traffic Control Modernization Plan integrates AI to manage rising drone and air traffic, while Iran\u2019s Shahid Baqeri carrier emphasizes swarm tactics. These advancements highlight the need for enhanced detection and response capabilities in modern warfare and surveillance.\nAI and machine learning integration transforms UAV operations by enabling autonomous threat response and precision targeting. Systems, including Shield AI\u2019s Hivemind, allow drones to navigate GPS-denied environments, while the U.S. Army\u2019s Leonidas and BlueHalo\u2019s METIS systems use AI for drone swarm neutralization and threat detection. The Anduril-OpenAI partnership enhances real-time situational awareness and dual-use AI vision systems, such as Teledyne\u2019s projected USD 9.29 billion market, serving defense and commercial sectors. Strategic collaborations, such as Lockheed Martin-Rheinmetall\u2019s GaN radar venture and AUKUS AI trials, drive innovation and cost efficiencies. Regulatory advancements, including the FAA\u2019s BVLOS mandate and ANRA Technologies\u2019 U-Space platform, further accelerate AI-driven UAV systems' market growth.\nPower-Intensity of AESA Radars and Legacy Aircraft Compatibility Issues to Increase Operational Limitations in Small UAVs and MALE Platforms\nPower and Compatibility Challenges AESA Radars in UAVs: AESA radars that consume 3\u20135 kW significantly reduce small UAV endurance, as demonstrated by the MQ-1C Gray Eagle\u2019s 25% flight time reduction with the AN/APY-8 Lynx radar. Retrofitting AESA onto legacy platforms such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk adds 15\u201320% weight and costs over USD 12 million per unit. Thermal management in compact UAVs requires complex liquid cooling, delaying projects such as Baykar\u2019s Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UAV by eight months in 2024. Recent efforts, such as BAE Systems\u2019 Ultra-Low-Power AESA in September 2024, cut power use by 30% but compromised the range for ISR roles. General Atomics\u2019 retrofit of AN/APG-79 AESA on Predator B drones also faced USD 200 million cost overruns in June 2024.\nCost and Complexity Barriers to Fleet-Wide Modernization: Upgrading large fleets such as the F-16V with AESA radars costs USD 4\u20136 billion, covering retrofits, training, and maintenance. Supply chain issues, particularly GaN semiconductor shortages in 2024\u20132025, delay production, impacting programs including Lockheed Martin\u2019s Sniper ATP.
