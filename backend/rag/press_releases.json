    "content": "New paper builds on the 2025 Automated Flight Rules Concept of Operations and outlines a path to scalable, high-density UAM integration AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 18, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- SkyGrid, an Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Third-Party Service Provider (TSP), and Wisk Aero, an autonomous aviation company, have released a new white paper, Enabling Scalable Urban Air Mobility Through Automated Flight Rules, outlining how Automated Flight Rules (AFR) can enable the safe and scalable integration of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations into global airspace. The white paper builds on the Automated Flight Rules Concept of Operations jointly released by SkyGrid, Wisk, and Boeing in December 2025, advancing the conversation from a high-level framework to a focused application for low-altitude UAM operations. As passenger-carrying electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft move closer to commercial operations, integrating high-tempo flights into already complex urban airspace remains a critical challenge. SkyGrid and Wisk propose that scalable UAM will require a coordinated evolution of airspace management, including: Advanced automated traffic management systems The introduction of new airspace structures, referred to as Class X airspace The establishment of a new operating mode, Automated Flight Rules AFR is designed to complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 existing Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). While traditional flight rules rely on human-to-human voice coordination and air traffic control separation services, AFR enables properly equipped aircraft to use certified automation for conflict management and decision-making. This shift supports higher-density operations while maintaining safety and reducing controller workload. The white paper focuses specifically on how AFR can support UAM operations in low-altitude (< 4000ft. AGL) urban environments, where flights are expected to operate at tempos comparable to major airports and in close proximity to existing Class B, C, and D airspace. \"Urban Air Mobility cannot scale under today's human-centric traffic management model alone,\" said Jia Xu, CEO of SkyGrid. \"Automated Flight Rules represent the next logical evolution in aviation \u2014 leveraging certified automation to enable predictable, high-density operations while maintaining the highest standards of safety. This white paper provides a practical framework for how that future can be realized.\" \"As we prepare for commercial operations, airspace modernization must evolve alongside aircraft innovation, which is why Wisk is designing the Gen 6 aircraft to be compatible with the AFR concepts outlined in this whitepaper,\" said Erick Corona, Head of Systems and Operations Integration at Wisk. \"This paper outlines how AFR and automated traffic management can unlock scalable, efficient operations in urban environments, enabling us to deliver safe and accessible autonomous AAM at scale.\""

    "content": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Feb. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Amca, an El Segundo-based aerospace and defense company, has acquired Electrocube of Pomona, California from two of its founding families. The transaction adds flight-critical power electronics to Amca's growing capabilities. Shedd Capital served as an advisor on the deal. Amca acquires legacy aerospace and defense suppliers and equips them to rapidly design, qualify, and manufacture components to reduce supply chain risk and accelerate time-to-field across the industry. During its first year of ownership, Amca will invest significantly in expanding Electrocube's engineering and product catalog. For decades, Electrocube has been one of Boeing's most trusted partners, as a key supplier of transformers for over 35 different use cases across the plane on nearly every one of its commercial platforms. Out of over 5,000 direct suppliers to Boeing, Electrocube ranks in the top 20 in its annual rankings for near-perfect quality, on-time delivery, and responsiveness. It's a testament to the company's relentless focus on customer service that has been part of the company's DNA since its founding. In 1961, three World War II vets, Lang Parrill, Roland Duquette, and Charles Wieland founded Electrocube. Over the next few decades, they would successfully build their business into a definitive industry leader, now counting Honeywell, GE, and others as key customers for its line of transformers, TRUs, capacitors, and EMI filters. Clay Parrill and Don Duquette, current owners and sons of Lang and Roland, never expected to take the helm of Electrocube. But when their fathers were ready to retire in the 1990s and there was no other succession plan in place, the two decided to partner up and steward their families' business. Since then, the duo has successfully grown the business over eleven-fold and into a top Boeing supplier. It's this heritage that makes Electrocube a strong foundation for Amca's power electronics division. Amca was founded to address the growing fragility of the aerospace and defense supply base by eliminating single points of failure and enabling rapid design and production of critical components optimized for advanced and high-volume systems. Electrocube's stellar reputation and customer base provide Amca's team with an established platform to serve customers' power electronics needs. \"When we met with Amca, the energy and enthusiasm they had was infectious. It's exciting to be a part of something that could really change the trajectory of the aerospace industry,\" said Clay Parrill, president and CEO of Electrocube."

The inspection of pipelines, offshore platforms, and refineries is non-negotiable, with intense regulatory pressure to prevent catastrophic failures and environmental incidents, thereby creating a sustained, high-volume need for NDT. This impetus is magnified by a surge in global defense spending, which reached US$ 2.46 trillion in 2024. Pipeline Monitoring and Corrosion Mapping Boost Predictive Maintenance Adoption Finally, the accelerating integration of predictive maintenance across high-stakes industries is cementing long-term growth prospects. The global predictive maintenance market, valued at US$ 7.5 billion in 2024, is heavily reliant on NDT data to optimize functional availability. In the oil and gas sector, this translates to the continuous monitoring of pipeline wall thickness, corrosion mapping in storage tanks, and assessing the integrity of critical welds in pressure vessels to prevent costly downtime. In aerospace, this trend is complemented by the growth of the aerospace composites market, valued at US$ 29.2 billion in 2024, as these materials demand specialized NDT protocols. This technological evolution also necessitates significant investment in human capital, with training costs like US$ 1,095 for a foundational Ultrasonic Testing Level I course highlighting the universal need for a skilled workforce to operate this sophisticated equipment."

This year is set to mark the fourth consecutive profitable year for the sector, helping airlines to recover over 80% of the US$182 billion lost during the pandemic. India, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia are positioned to lead aviation\u2019s next growth cycle, with the three countries\u2019 combined order backlog at over 3,000 aircraft. This represents more than double the current in-service fleet, with 900 aircraft to be delivered over the next 3 years. Demand fundamentals remain positive but airlines risk missing out on growth opportunities due to the persistent structural undersupply of aircraft. Order backlogs at Airbus and Boeing now extend to over 11 years. The ongoing supply shortage will support higher lease rates and strong residual values, while increasing the strategic value of lessor-held slots for under-ordered airlines. Avolon's 2026 Outlook: Up Next paper, available here, reviews the key trends in the aviation sector in 2026 and beyond, including: Aviation Growth: Regional growth will be varied. India, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are emerging as the next growth regions for the aviation sector. European growth is being driven by low-cost carriers as the majors focus on consolidation. U.S. network carriers are transitioning into lifestyle brands that run highly profitable loyalty and credit card businesses, while low-cost carriers continue to struggle as they work to realign their networks and products. Asia-Pacific is limited by fleet constraints, with China having a near-term requirement for 1,000 new aircraft. Airlines: Lower fuel prices were a key driver for airline performance in 2025, with US$8 billion in reduced fuel expenses accounting for a fifth of the airline industry's net profits. This trend is expected to continue in 2026, helping airlines further repair their balance sheets despite operational challenges and increasing labour and maintenance costs. Manufacturers: Despite the uncertain geopolitical backdrop, large investment decisions are being made with orders for over 2,000 new aircraft placed with Airbus, Boeing, and Embraer in 2025. The market is shifting toward larger aircraft variants, with the A321neo outselling the A320neo aircraft three-to-one over the past three years. The A330neo is benefiting as the only new passenger widebody available before 2032. Engine manufacturers are increasing shop visit and spare part pricing at rates well above general inflation as they manage higher input costs and deliver rising shareholder returns. The market value of two full-life engines now represents c.80% of a new aircraft\u2019s value. Lessors: A structural re-rating of the aircraft leasing business model has occurred with eleven lessors now achieving investment grade ratings, positioning them to outperform in a market of scarce aircraft. Around US$120 billion of new aircraft are expected to deliver in 2026, up 20% on last year. With lessors expected to provide around half of the global fleet\u2019s overall financing requirements, their importance in supporting the transition to lower emissions new-technology aircraft has never been stronger. Risks: The rapid growth of AI is intensifying competition with aviation for capital and talent. Geopolitical risk will continue to be in focus in 2026, and whilst tariff fears for aviation subsided in 2025, they remain a sensitive issue. Economic growth proved resilient in 2025, 80 of the largest economies grew by more than 1% and 90 are expected to do so in 2026 with none expected to shrink."

    "content": "The startup\u2019s focus is on building rapidly certifiable systems to redefine the economics of aerospace manufacturing Motion control startup positioned to become the youngest company with components on commercial aircraft Initiative breaks the industry\u2019s reliance on legacy suppliers by introducing modern, certifiable second-source solutions for commercial aircraft TORRANCE, Calif., January 15, 2026--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Salient Motion, an aerospace and defense component supplier, has developed motion control systems for commercial aircraft that can achieve certification in months rather than years, marking a significant departure from traditional aerospace development timelines. The company is working with Boeing to advance actuation systems\u2014the mechanisms behind aircraft functions ranging from passenger seating to cargo handling\u2014using a modular platform that reuses certified components across programs. Salient Motion\u2019s technology replaces decades-old, single-use hardware architectures with a reconfigurable platform that\u2019s built more like a modern software stack, reusable, upgradable, and fast to certify. Founded in 2022, the company is moving through the certification process at a pace unusual for the aerospace industry. \"In aerospace, certification costs and timelines have always been the biggest drag on innovation,\" said Vishaal Mali, Salient Motion\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \"By modularizing hardware and reusing certified software across systems, we're compressing development timelines and cutting those costs dramatically.\" A Strategic Signal from AE Ventures The company's approach has attracted investment from AE Ventures, reflecting growing market interest in startups that can accelerate aerospace digital transformation. Unlike conventional supplier relationships, Salient Motion's model treats OEMs as development partners\u2014sharing R&D investment and aftermarket revenue while reducing non-recurring engineering costs for each new program. \"Our modular platform lets aerospace evolve the way software does,\" Mali said. \"Certify once, deploy everywhere. That\u2019s the leverage modern aviation has been missing.\" Why it Matters: A New Economics of Innovation The aerospace industry has long been trapped by single-source suppliers and certification cycles that push costs to the breaking point. Salient Motion\u2019s modular platform breaks that pattern. By reusing previously certified hardware and software across aircraft programs, the company can develop and qualify new systems in a fraction of the time, dramatically lowering the cost of getting components to market. Standardized digital interfaces further simplify integration, reducing engineering overhead and shortening production timelines."

    "content": "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Weiss Ratings, which accepts no direct or indirect compensation from rated companies, has published a data-heavy report today with \"Sell\" ratings (D+ or lower) on The Boeing Company (BA), Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD) and Cloudflare (NET), while documenting serious conflicts of interest that inflate the ratings issued by most Wall Street analysts. In addition to many other factors, Boeing is rated D- due to a net loss of $9.85 billion over the last four quarters, negative equity of $8.3 billion, a $3.1 billion decline cash on hand; Warner Brothers is rated D+ largely due to sharp declines in earnings growth, revenue growth and cash inflows; while Cloudflare is rated D-, mainly thanks to EBITDA at a negative $48.7 million and a net decline in cash from investing to the tune of $1.7 billion. Among all stocks currently rated by Weiss, 8% are \"Buys,\" 24% are \"Holds\" and 69% are \"Sells.\" In contrast, at year-end 2025, despite higher-than-average stock valuations, 95% of Wall Street stock ratings on S&P 500 stocks urged investors to buy or at least hold, while only 5% advised them to sell. And among stocks in the S&P 1500 as well as broader market indexes that include many higher-risk small-cap stocks, the percentages are surprisingly similar. Dr. Martin D. Weiss, founder of Weiss Ratings commented: \"Whether the market is rising or falling, investors underestimate how stock losses can be significantly magnified by conflicts of interest and bias among analysts at research firms on or off Wall Street. Moreover, inflated stock ratings have, in themselves, often been a factor behind financial bubbles and busts, deepening market declines and aggravating any economic crisis.\" In its report issued today, \"How Wall Street Ratings Help Cause Historic Investor Losses,\" Weiss documents how most stock ratings have historically magnified investor losses during market declines since 2000: The Dot-Com Bust of 2000-2003.\u00a0A survey of research analysts conducted prior to the decline revealed that only a very small percentage of Wall Street analysts issued \"Sell\" ratings on internet and other tech stocks. Nearly all were rated \"Buy\" or at least \"Hold.\" The Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Between Oct. 9, 2007, and March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 fell 55%. At the same time, 41 blue-chips stocks fell by 90% or more. However, on average, only one out of 15 analysts warned investors about these big losers with a \"Sell\" rating. Most urged investors to buy precisely at the worst time, and many did not change their opinion even as the stocks fell."

The airline also secured rights for an additional 35 737-10 aircraft. This order \u2013 representing the largest order in the airline's history \u2013 secures critical delivery slots and extends the aircraft delivery stream through 2035. \"This fleet investment builds on the strong foundation Alaska has created to support steady, scalable and sustained growth, and is another building block in executing our Alaska Accelerate strategic plan,\" said CEO Ben Minicucci. \"These planes will fuel our expansion to more destinations across the globe and ensure our guests travel aboard the newest, most fuel-efficient and state-of-the-art aircraft. We are incredibly proud to be partnering with Boeing, a Pacific Northwest neighbor and a company that stands as a symbol of American innovation and manufacturing.\" This order brings Alaska's total orderbook with Boeing to 245 aircraft, in addition to the 94 MAX aircraft we're operating today. A mix of growth aircraft and replacement for aging 737s, this order will keep Alaska's fleet one of the youngest in the industry and the most fuel efficient for any premium, global airline. Alaska already operates a narrowbody fleet that includes 737-9 and 737-8 aircraft. This order is for 737-10 aircraft, but the airline retains the flexibility to adjust to a different model if necessary. The five additional 787 widebody aircraft support the Alaska Accelerate strategic plan and will enable the airline to fly to at least 12 long-haul international destinations from Seattle by 2030. The order brings our firm future 787 widebody fleet to 17, with five already in operation across the network. The intention is for these five 787s to be delivered as the -10 variant. With a current fleet of 413 aircraft, Alaska Air Group's carriers will operate a fleet of more than 475 aircraft by 2030 and more than 550 aircraft by 2035. This morning in Seattle, leaders from Alaska Airlines, Boeing and the U.S. Department of Transportation will join with employees, customers and guests to celebrate this fleet order and welcome the first 787-9 painted in Alaska's global livery. The new 787-9 exterior design draws inspiration from the natural wonder of the Aurora Borealis, featuring a palette of deep midnight blues and lush emerald greens that channel the aurora's energy and spirit of the Alaska brand.\u00a0Utilizing a new aircraft painting technique, it took artists nearly 1000 hours across 13 days to paint the aircraft exterior from nose to tail."

    "content": "New Room Alert monitor bundles protects facility-wide network infrastructure against overlooked environment threats WARREN, RHODE ISLAND / ACCESS Newswire / January 6, 2026 / AVTECH Software (AVTECH), the leading provider of proactive environment monitoring solutions, today announced the launch of their new Room Alert PRO MDF/IDF Monitor bundle, designed to specifically protect Main Distribution Frame (MDF) and Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) closets from environment-related equipment failures. In business for nearly 40 years, AVTECH manufactures Room Alert, the world's most popular environment monitor for business continuity plans, outage prevention, and workplace safety. Room Alert is made in the USA and proactively monitors environment conditions such as temperature, humidity, flood, power, smoke, and more. Room Alert is currently used in 187 of 196 countries by organizations ranging from thousands of small businesses to Boeing, Sprint, Microsoft, over 80% of the Fortune 1000, the United Nations, and many government agencies. The Room Alert PRO MDF/IDF Bundle addresses a critical vulnerability in enterprise IT infrastructure. Network closets house essential switches, patch panels, and routers that form the physical backbone of organizational connectivity, yet these mission-critical spaces are frequently left unattended and unmonitored. Environment-related factors cause a wide range of network equipment failures, and a single IDF failure can cascade into widespread network outages resulting in significant financial losses and damage to a company's reputation. This comprehensive bundle includes a Room Alert 12SR monitor along with a number of digital sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, airflow, power status, water intrusion, and smoke. Additionally, a Room Entry Sensor provides security monitoring to detect unauthorized access attempts in these often-remote locations. The bundle specifically addresses the primary threats facing network closets: overheating from inadequate cooling or ventilation, fire risk from densely packed electrical components, water damage from hidden leaks or HVAC condensation, power fluctuations, and physical security vulnerabilities. When conditions exceed pre-set thresholds, Room Alert sends instant notifications via push notification, SMS, or email, giving IT teams the time needed to prevent local failures from becoming network-wide disasters. \"Network closets are the most overlooked and vulnerable points in IT infrastructure,\" said Rick Grundy, President and CEO at AVTECH. \"Our new Room Alert PRO MDF/IDF Bundle transforms these potential disaster zones into protected, reliable nodes of the network. By offering this pre-configured solution at an affordable price point of $1,449, we're making enterprise-grade environmental monitoring accessible for organizations of all sizes.\""

In 2025, Jetaire secured two major international validations of INVICTA, its proprietary, innovative, and trusted alternative to complicated nitrogen-generating ignition mitigation systems for Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) validated Jetaire's Boeing 737 Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), making INVICTA the only approved alternative to nitrogen-generating systems for the platform in the region. The UAE approval carries immediate commercial impact; multiple Boeing aircraft committed for modification. This reflects strong confidence from aircraft owners and managers in Jetaire's design integrity, engineering rigor, and long-term product reliability; the attributes distinguishing Jetaire in a highly regulated safety environment. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approved Jetaire's Airbus A330 STC this week. Adopted by multiple carriers in Latin America, INVICTA has global acceptance and operational flexibility across diverse regulatory and operating environments. Simplicity, passive reliability, and lifecycle efficiency are the fundamentally different solutions INVICTA provides to fuel tank flammability reduction. Jetaire, the first company to be awarded FAA STC approval for this category of ignition mitigation technology, established the technical foundation which influences the broader market. Jetaire's innovation created a compliance pathway for operators seeking a lighter, lower-maintenance, and highly effective alternative to traditional nitrogen-generating systems. \"Every approval reinforces what operators and regulators already recognize\u2014INVICTA is not an adaptation of legacy technology, it is the original solution,\" said Michael Williams, Founder and CEO of Jetaire Group. \"Our continued success with the FAA, GCAA, and now EASA reflects decades of focused engineering and a relentless commitment to advancing aviation safety.\" As regulatory scrutiny and fleet modernization continue worldwide, Jetaire Group delivers the technology that defined the category and continues to set the standard. About Jetaire Group\u00a0Fayetteville, Georgia-based Jetaire Group is a leading manufacturer of aviation safety technology, specializing in fuel tank flammability reduction solutions. Its flagship product, INVICTA, is revolutionizing the industry by providing a cost-effective, maintenance-free alternative to nitrogen-generating systems for Airbus and Boeing aircraft.

The MND currently leases eight aircraft from the U.S. Army. \"This important agreement allows us to begin building one of the largest and most formidable Apache fleets that the world has ever seen,\" said Christina Upah, vice president of Boeing's Attack Helicopter Programs. \"Working closely with the Polish Armed Forces, we're focused on disciplined execution to help enhance Poland's defense capabilities and keep up with the strong demand for the most advanced attack helicopter.\" Through an offset agreement announced last year between Boeing and the Polish MND, local industry will play a key role in performing maintenance and support of the Apache fleet. Boeing will also establish training programs and help develop a composite laboratory. Boeing recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apache's first flight at its Mesa production facility. Today's E-model Apache has evolved to become the most proven, advanced configuration that brings unmatched lethality, survivability, connectivity and interoperability to the battlefield.

    "content": "WICHITA, Kan., Oct. 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Third quarter 2025 Revenues of $1.6 billion EPS of $(6.16); Adjusted EPS* of $(4.87) Cash used in operations of $187 million; Free cash flow* usage of $230 million Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPR) (\"Spirit,\" \"Spirit AeroSystems\" or the \"Company\") reported third quarter 2025 financial results. Revenue Spirit's revenue in the third quarter of 2025 increased from the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher production activity on Boeing, Airbus and Defense & Space programs. Overall deliveries increased during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period of 2024. Boeing 737 deliveries were significantly higher year-over-year due to the delay in deliveries during 2024 caused by the joint product verification process initiated by Boeing. Spirit's backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2025 was approximately $52 billion, which includes work packages on all commercial platforms in the Airbus and Boeing backlog. Earnings Operating loss in the third quarter of 2025 increased compared to the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher changes in estimates charges and lower program margins on Boeing programs, partially offset by lower excess capacity charges and a reversal of accrued liabilities. Total changes in estimates in the third quarter of 2025 included net forward losses of $585 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $14 million. The forward losses in the third quarter were primarily driven by the Boeing 737, Boeing 787, Airbus A220 and Airbus A350 programs, largely due to supply chain and production cost growth. Unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were primarily driven by increased production costs on the Boeing 737 and 777 programs. Excess capacity costs during the third quarter of 2025 were $55 million. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2025, the Company reversed $48 million of accrued liabilities related to the favorable resolution of litigation with a former CEO. In comparison, in the third quarter of 2024, net forward losses were $217 million, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $26 million, and excess capacity costs were $70 million. Third quarter 2025 EPS was $(6.16), compared to $(4.07) in the same period of 2024. Adjusted to exclude the incremental deferred tax asset valuation allowance, third quarter 2025 adjusted EPS* was $(4.87), compared to $(3.03) in the third quarter of 2024. Cash Cash from operations and free cash flow* usage during the third quarter of 2025 improved compared to the same period of 2024, largely resulting from the timing of working capital driven by higher Boeing 737 deliveries. The Company's cash balance at the end of the third quarter of 2025 was $299 million."

Kristin Berthelsen: Yeah, so what we actually have seen after we actually turned off investing in traditional marketing, we increased the load factor. We are using Instagram is one, but one even more important is a younger audience, and that's TikTok. So, we see we have a lot of followers. We actually have more followers than most of the airlines on TikTok. And for me, it's some of the things it's hard to understand. I'm too old, but they are attracting the young travelers for the future. We have a lot of youngsters traveling with Norse. Brian Lantier: Okay, that's fantastic. And talk a little bit about what led you to the decision to lease the aircraft to IndiGo and sort of where you see that going. Will that be the strategy for the next three to five years? Kristin Berthelsen: Yeah, so first of all, I think it was based on the experience that we had been too optimistic regarding Oslo and Gatwick as very attractive places to fly from. And we also had been outcompeted by big airlines that could easily go lower on price just to take us out. It was very important for us to deliver profit to our investors. So, we had very passionate discussions about are we willing to give away six aircraft? Not to fly them ourselves. And that was hard emotionally, but we have been so strict that we should take no decision based on emotion. We need to take them based on the facts. We looked into the development of society, and we thought, okay, we might do a risk by losing some of the profit we could have had, but now we're securing six and being more optimistic on the six others. So, it has been very well. So, our investor has said that that was a wise choice, and we have gotten even more investors after we take that choice. Brian Lantier: And do you think that the, I guess, have you released any details on the terms of that lease? Are there any ratchets in there? Are there any adjustments? Kristin Berthelsen: We have said some about the flying hours a month, like 350 hours, so people can look into it, but it's a balance because it's also IndiGo matterless. Brian Lantier: So, it matters for the industry privacy of that. Can you talk a little bit about what drives your decision to? You've obviously learned something when you've chosen different routes, and some of them didn't work out. Now that you've had success with the London to Cape Town route, what goes into your thinking now when you approach looking at new long-haul routes?"

Boeing, Qualcomm, City and County of Denver Tout Transformational Impact of Proprietary Look at Newly Accessible Data Purchaser Business Group on Health | Leveraging Health Care Price Transparency OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Purchaser Business Group on Health (PBGH), a nonprofit coalition representing dozens of the largest private and public employers in the U.S., today released the results of its groundbreaking Health Care Data Demonstration Project. The initiative, launched amid the biggest increase in health care costs for employers in more than a decade, marks the first time employers have had access to the data needed to compare what they actually paid for health care services against what they should have paid, allowing them to pinpoint overpayments, challenge hidden fees, and demand accountability from health plans and providers. The demonstration, conducted with five major employers, including Boeing, Qualcomm, and the City and County of Denver, combines Hospital Price Transparency (HPT) and Transparency in Coverage (TiC) data with claims, quality, and safety information. The result is a powerful set of tools that reveal what constitutes a fair price\u2014aligned with the fiduciary standard under federal law\u2014and in some cases exposes the failure of third-party administrators (TPAs) and carriers to deliver value. Direct contracts, in contrast, demonstrated the best pricing and highest value. \u201cFor decades, the health care industry has fought to keep pricing hidden because opacity enabled them to overcharge employers and employees,\u201d said Elizabeth Mitchell, president and CEO of PBGH. \u201cThis project finally puts the truth in employers\u2019 hands. It shows them not just what they paid, but what they should have paid\u2014and that discrepancy is where hidden fees and profiteering live. It is transformative because it enables employers to fulfill their fiduciary duties, hold vendors accountable, and drive down costs for their workforce.\u201d Unlike All-Payer Claims Databases (APCDs) and other limited initiatives that simply show what was paid\u2014without context, quality measures, or the ability to identify specific plans or providers\u2014PBGH\u2019s model delivers actionable, employer-specific insights. For the first time, employers can see how their payments compare to national commercial benchmarks, identify high-value providers, and target the areas where they are being overcharged."

    "content": "Airspace Modernisation: A Guide to Essential Aviation Technology Advancements Morris Plains, NJ, Sept. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), airspace modernisation can be defined as \u201cimproving our airspace structure through new technology, including more accurate satellite-based navigation, and introducing more efficient flight paths.\u201d The U.K. Department for Transport also states that, despite great technological advances, the basic design of U.K. airspace hasn\u2019t significantly changed in 70 years. According to the BBC, back in the 1950s, when the airspace was originally designed, there were around 200,000 flights in U.K. airspace annually. Last year, the U.K. handled 2.7 million flights. If you cast your mind back to the 1950s, Boeing had just brought their first jetliner to market, the 707, which entered service with Pan Am in 1958. Why Modernising Airspace Matters Now Since then, the two largest manufacturers in the aviation sector, Boeing and Airbus, have introduced 15 different commercial airliners between them, with many variants of the different aircraft being released. Each has contained new technologies, making aviation safer and greener for the billions of passengers who have flown on Boeing and Airbus aircraft over the years. With this in mind, it is easy to see how these aviation technology advancements have changed flight, but airspace and the way we use it have not kept pace. This means that we are not experiencing the full potential benefits of the new technology on offer. Technological Advances Driving Change Among the largest technological advancements made have been the ETOPS ratings achieved by some of the new generation passenger aircraft. ETOPS stands for \u201cExtended range Twin-engine Operations Performance Standards.\u201d In 2017, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) introduced another term for this, EDTO, which stands for \u201cEstimated Diversion Time Operations.\u201d The two terms have a similar meaning, and both are still widely used in aviation today. These ratings essentially refer to how far an aircraft of a particular type can be, during any one journey, from an airport suitable for landing. As time and technology have progressed, the ETOPS ratings achieved have become higher, which means that when routing a flight, airlines are able to fly a more direct route. Some of the newest generation aircraft certified for ETOPS 370 can be up to 6 hours and 10 minutes from the nearest airport at any given point during the flight, depending on the ETOPS certification of the operator on that given aircraft type. This certification is a dual certification, with both the aircraft and the operator achieving a rating."

    "content": "Faulty fuel cutoff switch allegedly caused plane to become a \"250,000-pound lawn dart\" WILMINGTON, Del., September 17, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The families of four passengers who died in the catastrophic crash of Air India Flight 171 have filed a product defect and negligence lawsuit against The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) and Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON). The lawsuit alleges a faulty fuel cutoff switch led to the crash that killed 242 people aboard the aircraft and 19 more on the ground shortly after takeoff from the international airport in Ahmedabad, India, in June of this year. Video of the attorney discussing the case available for use here. According to the lawsuit, filed in Delaware Superior Court, flight data indicates that an Air India pilot accidentally shut off fuel to the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner\u2019s engines, causing a complete loss of thrust necessary to complete the takeoff. The fuel cutoff switch, manufactured by Honeywell and installed by Boeing, is designed with a locking mechanism to prevent unintended cutoff of fuel supply to the engines mid-flight. But the lawsuit says these switches are installed in a \"high traffic\" location immediately behind and adjacent to the thrust levers that pilots continuously manipulate during takeoff. In addition, documents show that both Honeywell and Boeing knew the locking mechanism could easily be turned off inadvertently or could be missing altogether. That assertion is supported by a 2018 Federal Aviation Administration report confirming that Boeing and Honeywell were aware that switches were being delivered on the aircraft with the locking mechanism disengaged, allowing for \"unintended\" fuel cutoff mid-flight. However, there is no evidence that the companies alerted Air India or other customers that the switches must be inspected and repaired for passenger safety and did not ship replacement switches to those airlines for installation. \"It is shocking that Honeywell and Boeing both knew of this danger and did absolutely nothing to prevent the inevitable catastrophe that occurred on June 12,\" says Benjamin Major of The Lanier Law Firm, co-counsel for the families. \"This defect is comparable to an auto manufacturer putting an unprotected emergency brake control next to a radio volume knob in your car. And unlike a car, restarting jet engines takes minutes of time, not seconds. Once these engines shut down, that plane basically became a 250,000-pound lawn dart.\" According to the lawsuit, both switches on the Flight 171 aircraft suddenly and inadvertently moved from the \"RUN\" to the \"CUTOFF\" position just three seconds after liftoff, completely cutting fuel supply to both engines. A cockpit voice recorder captured a brief exchange between the pilots, indicating that neither intended to shut off fuel to the aircraft. Despite the pilots\u2019 attempts to restore engine power, there was insufficient time for the engines to restart and provide adequate thrust to prevent the crash. The crew transmitted a Mayday call, and six seconds later the Dreamliner crashed into multiple buildings located just one nautical mile from the end of the runway."

The event brought together Qarbon employees, Boeing leadership, Congressman Jake Ellzey (TX-06), and members of the Vought Heritage Foundation. Their presence made the celebration especially meaningful, as Qarbon Aerospace carries forward a proud legacy that began with Vought more than a century ago, producing generations of iconic aircraft and continuing today at Qarbon with the T-7A Red Hawk. Qarbon Aerospace builds the forward fuselage, wing, and empennage assemblies of the T-7A. These complex structures are assembled at the Red Oak facility with the same focus on safety, quality and precision that has long defined Qarbon\u2019s contributions to aerospace. Speakers included Congressman Ellzey, who represents Texas\u2019 6th District and is a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot, and Charlisha \"Charli\" Greene, Vice President of Air Dominance Supply Chain at Boeing. Both emphasized the importance of the T-7A Red Hawk program in preparing the next generation of U.S. Air Force pilots and strengthening national defense, while also recognizing the critical partnerships and people that make it possible. \"Today is about more than a single part or program milestone,\" said Mike Canario, Chief Executive Officer of Qarbon Aerospace. \"It represents the incredible work of our people, the strength of our partnership with Boeing, and the continuation of a proud legacy of building some of the world\u2019s most iconic aircraft. The T-7A Red Hawk is shaping the future of pilot training, and we are honored that Qarbon is part of this important mission.\" Congressman Ellzey spoke to the importance of both the program and the people behind it: \"The T-7A Red Hawk will prepare the next generation of Air Force pilots to carry out their missions, and it\u2019s being built right here in Red Oak. I am proud of the hardworking men and women at Qarbon Aerospace whose skill and dedication make milestones like today possible. This is not just about building airplanes. It\u2019s about securing America\u2019s future, strengthening our defense, and continuing a proud legacy of aviation right here in our backyard.\" Charli Greene of Boeing added: \"Preparing future fighter and bomber pilots for the rigors of combat in the most advanced crewed jets is a daunting task.

The vehicle is healthy on orbit and proceeding with standard checkout. Less than six months after completing its seventh mission with a landing at Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., on March 7, 2025, the spaceplane is back in space. This mission includes a Boeing integrated service module to increase payload capacity for experimentation activities on orbit. \"Our role is to make sure the spaceplane is the most reliable testbed it can be,\" said Michelle Parker, vice president of Boeing Space Mission Systems. \"None of this happens without teamwork. Launch is the starting line for this mission, but the work that follows \u2013the quiet, methodical work on orbit, analysis and eventual return is where progress is earned.\" The X-37B is hosting several technology demonstrations from government partners on this mission, include laser communications and a quantum inertial sensor designed to support navigation when GPS is unavailable. On its previous mission, the vehicle executed a first of its kind aerobraking maneuver to change orbits while conserving propellant. \"Having a returnable space platform allows us to learn faster,\" said Col. Brian Chatman, installation commander for Space Launch Delta 45. \"The data we gather from the X-37B speeds decisions, hardens our architectures, and helps Guardians stay connected and on course even in contested environments. This is how we move from promising ideas to fieldable capability at pace.\" The X 37B is a government\u2013industry partnership led by the U.S. Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, with the U.S. Space Force overseeing operations. Boeing teams primarily based in Seal Beach, Calif., and Kennedy Space Center, Fla., design, build, integrate and operate the reusable spaceplane. Since first flight in 2010, the orbital test vehicle has completed seven missions and accumulated more than 4,200 days in space, returning after each flight for inspection and augmentation. A leading global aerospace company and top U.S. exporter, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries.

    "content": "Executive urges a shift toward adaptive, people-first strategies in complex markets TACOMA, WA / ACCESS Newswire / August 12, 2025 / With markets becoming more unpredictable and business challenges more complex, respected executive and strategic growth leader Jonathan Kniss is urging companies to focus on agile leadership, operational clarity, and human-focused decision-making. Drawing on decades of experience with Boeing and Quest Integrated, Kniss is speaking out about what leadership really requires in fast-changing times. \"You can't control the pace of the market,\" said Kniss, \"but you can build teams that move fast, stay clear on the mission, and adapt without losing focus.\" Kniss's call to action follows the recent spotlight article, \"Jonathan Kniss: The Leader Who Builds Stronger Businesses,\" which details his rise through eight promotions at Boeing and his strategic success growing Qi2 Systems at Quest Integrated. Why This Message Matters Now According to a 2024 McKinsey Global Survey, only 10% of executives say their organizations are highly agile, even though 70% agree agility is critical to long-term performance. And in a 2023 PwC CEO survey, 52% of global CEOs said their business model would not be viable in 10 years without major transformation. Kniss believes the disconnect comes from outdated leadership styles. \"The market's changing, but too many leaders are still using 1990s playbooks,\" he said. \"You have to shift. You have to learn. And you need to bring your people with you.\" The Three Areas Kniss Is Advocating For 1. Adaptive Strategy Over Static Planning Traditional long-term plans don't hold up in modern business climates. Kniss says strategic planning must be living, flexible, and team-driven. \"We need to stop seeing strategy as a PowerPoint deck and start seeing it as a system we revisit constantly,\" Kniss said. 2. Operational Clarity Over Complexity Too many organizations get lost in layers of red tape and internal noise. Kniss pushes for sharper execution, tighter communication, and clear ownership of outcomes. \"When teams know the goal, the tools, and the why-they move faster and with more purpose,\" he said. \"At Boeing, clarity is what moved big projects forward.\" 3. People-First Culture Over Short-Term Metrics Kniss has long believed that results follow strong relationships. He wants more leaders to invest in team trust, cross-functional collaboration, and authentic communication. \"You can't build anything meaningful without your people behind it,\" he said. \"You don't need fancy language-you need alignment and belief.\""
